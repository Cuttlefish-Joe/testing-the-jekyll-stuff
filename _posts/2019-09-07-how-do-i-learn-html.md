Maybe you have heard that HTML is the language used to make websites and you are wondering how do I learn this new language. Fortunately, for you there is enough learning materials and html is not complicated once you get a hang of it.

To learn HTML, you will have to:

## **1. Choose a good tutorial**

If you are wondering where can I learn HTML? Worry no more. There are many tutorials that you can use to learn HTML.Â  Here are some of the most popular ones are:

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/">Freecodecamp</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

Well detailed course with additional materials on CSS and Javascript once you master HTML.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Codecademy</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

It is the most recommended course on HTML. You will find it beginner-friendly and you won&#8217;t be bombarded by lots of unnecessary information.

Additional courses

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Course/HTML/">Sololearn</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

If you only have access to a smartphone, sololearn is a good application/ tool to learn html.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">Dash by general assembly</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

You will learn HTML and CSS by building projects.

I tried this course with some kids I was teaching how to make a webpage and they enjoyed it very much.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/">Interneting Is Hard</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

This tutorial has an overview of making webpages. I find this tutorial very friendly in the way it is broken down and the simple illustrations that it contains.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/">Learn to Code HTML by Shayhowe</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

You will learn how to build webpages using your own files. You will be able to build webpages offline.

#### **Take action:**

**Choose one course** that you are going to take. It does not matter which one you choose for now.

## **2. Tackle the tutorial**

Since you have already chosen the course, the next action is to do the course.

There are some few tips that can make your learning productive. Some of them are:

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure you type in the examples provided.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

When learning to code, trying out the examples provided in the playground area will help you remember what you have learnt.

If you just read through without trying out the examples provided, you won&#8217;t learn much.

  * Finish one course first.

As you learn HTML or anything, you will see another course that looks more interesting than the one you are using. Please, don&#8217;t jump around to different course. Finish one first.

After finishing one course and feel like you want to try a different one, you can do it.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Baby steps(small portions/ time)
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

Tackle small portions of the course at first and keep adding more time if you are more comfortable. When I am learning something new, I sometimes learn so much in a short time and I get information overload. To avoid this, read small portions. That way, you will retain much of the information.

#### **Take action:**

Go to the course of your choice and interact with the materials.

## **3. Practice: Build a project**

I am a big fan of practical projects because they test your understanding of information. In fact, I use them a lot to when I am learning something new.

So, build a practice project to solidify your understanding. To do this:

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Think of a topic and build a HTML project.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

It can be according to any topic of your choice. If you have a hobby or interest, use that. If you cannot think of a topic don&#8217;t worry.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose a topic from <a href="/100-html-practice-projects-ideas-for-beginners/">100 HTML project ideas</a> I have prepared. Read through the list and choose one topic.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

Then build a HTML web page. Make it as personal or unique as you want. It does not have to be fancy for now.
