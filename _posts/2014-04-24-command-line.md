title: Introduction to the command line
---

Powerful things happen with computers on the "command line".

You can get on the command line on a mac via the `Terminal` application.
On Windows you can follow [Michael G's instructions](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Unix%20101/Slides.html#slide3).

Here is a little introduction to the command line I just made:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/9111.js" id="asciicast-9111" async></script>

It's silent, so if you feel lonely you can listen to this, and feel hip at the same time:

If you would like to learn more, I would suggest the Learn Code The Hard Way [command line book](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
