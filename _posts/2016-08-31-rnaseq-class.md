[Galaxy](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) is an increasingly popular web-based platform for performing complex and reproducible computational biology analyses with no computer programming.
Though the original public Galaxy server, [Galaxy Main](http://usegalaxy.org), is free and open to the public, it cannot scale to meet everyone's needs.
Contention for computational resources among its thousands of users can lead to long wait times, and its data storage quotas can prohibit some types of analyses.
Consequently, many institutions around the world have made Galaxy available to their researchers locally, using their own computational resources and storage.
We've done the same with [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org), which is available on the Hutch internal network and uses the same infrastructure as Scientific Computing services.

RNA-seq has become a standard assay in molecular biology, and Galaxy has a comprehensive set of tools to help you learn from the results.
This hands-on workshop for Fred Hutch employees and affiliates is an introduction to RNA-seq differential expression analysis using Galaxy, including:

- Fetching data from public sources
- Mapping reads to a reference genome with TopHat2
- Counting reads mapping to genes
- Testing for differential expression with DESeq2

Attendees must bring a laptop to the course.
Please be sure your laptop can connect to the Marconi on-campus wireless network prior to the class, and use your fredhutch.org or affiliate email address when registering!

Register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rna-seq-differential-expression-analysis-using-galaxy-registration-26913507024).
Registration is limited to 20 participants.
If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list &mdash; please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to plan future workshop sessions.

Want to try working through the tutorial on your own?
No problem!
Register an account using your fredhutch.org email address at [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org) and give the [tutorial](https://github.com/fredhutchio/rnaseq-class/blob/gh-pages/index.md) a try.
