### **First session:** *Thursday, July 28, 2016 in D1-080/084, 3:00 - 5:00 pm*

### **Second session:** *Friday, July 29, 2016 in M1-A307, 2:00 - 4:00 pm*

(These sessions are independent and cover the same material; please register for only one.)

[Galaxy](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) is an increasingly popular web-based platform for performing complex and reproducible computational biology analyses with no computer programming.
Though the original public Galaxy server, [Galaxy Main](http://usegalaxy.org), is free and open to the public, it cannot scale to meet everyone's needs.
Contention for computational resources among its thousands of users can lead to long wait times, and its data storage quotas can prohibit some types of analyses.
Consequently, many institutions around the world have made Galaxy available to their researchers locally, using their own computational resources and storage.
We've done the same with [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org), which is available on the Hutch internal network and uses the same infrastructure as other Scientific Computing services.

This course will be a gentle introduction to Galaxy for researchers with little or no prior experience.
By working through the [Galaxy 101 tutorial](https://usegalaxy.org/u/aun1/p/galaxy101), attendees will learn the basics of Galaxy, including:

- Fetching data from public sources
- Performing simple data manipulation
- Working with multiple histories
- Creating, editing, and running workflows


Attendees must bring a laptop to the course.
Please be sure your laptop can connect to the Marconi on-campus wireless network prior to the class.

Register via Eventbrite for either the [Thursday, July 28, 2016 session](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/galaxy-101-registration-26554789089) or the [Friday, July 29, 2016 session](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/galaxy-101-registration-26572649510).
(These sessions are independent and cover the same material; please register for only one.)

Registration for each session is limited to 20 participants.

Want to try working through the tutorial on your own?
No problem!
Register an account using your fredhutch.org email address at [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org) and give the [Galaxy 101 tutorial](https://usegalaxy.org/u/aun1/p/galaxy101) a try.
There's also a step-by-step [screencast](http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/galaxy101/).
