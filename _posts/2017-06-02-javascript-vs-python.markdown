Over the last year I switched from writing server-side Python code to building a user interface with ReactJS. Here are the main differences I've noticed.

# Javascript and Python are surprisingly similar

Although the syntax is different, both languages pretty much do the same thing. Both languages support...
1. Iteration, filtering, and sorting of arrays on a single line of code.
1. Importing modules, classes, or function across different files
1. Unit testing
1. hello world program can be written on single line

**Advantages of Python**
- No annoying semi-colons.
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions that are super readable and fun to use
- More readable in general. Reads like poetry.

**Advantages of Javascript**
- Code can run in a web browser
- Better documentation online (The python docs are ugly in my opinion)
