#How the Ricoh GRD1 changed my Street Photography

I was like many young people who got into photography during the DLSR boom. Everyone wanted a Canon 550D so they could start making short films or take a stab at being a wedding photographer. Unfortunately no matter how many lenses or accessories I bought, my pictures just weren't getting better. 

Soon I stumbled across images from the Ricoh GRD1 on flickr. There was something very different about the photographs, they were gritty, messy, the colours were very contrasty and felt like they were alive. Immediately I purchased a used GRD on eBay for Â£80 and started shooting my commute to university everyday.

##Why did the Ricoh make me a better Street Photographer?

1. Well for the first time I had a camera with me everywhere I went, I could pull it from my coat pocket when something caught my eye. The camera became a notebook of the things that seemed out of place.

2. It forced me to end my relationship with "Bokeh". The 28mm equivalent lens and super small sensor meant everything was in focus, all the time. Something I now realise to be very important in the language of street photography. It made my photos more real, more like memories.

3. The grain quality when converted to black and white looks very, very film like. It gave me the film look, without any of the drawbacks of shooting film. I absolutely love film, but when I was starting out, I just wanted to see my images start away and share them online. It was great for practicing composition and gaining confidence on the street.

4. It made me think of images as part of project. I was no longer taking  random photographs, testing a lens or a flash accessory. My work had a purpose now. I was documenting a time and place in my life. 

###Final Thoughts 
I'll be the first to admit these images shown are not technically amazing. The highlights are completely blown out, but what can you expect from an 8mp camera with very outdated sensor technology. I think this camera serves a much great purpose though. It can build your confidence to shoot and start telling stories with your images. 

Though I have moved back to shooting with a film camera, I still miss those days shooting with the Ricoh. It was a very freeing experience, one I can highly recommend.
