### October 27-29, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

This course is directed at beginning and intermediate users who would like an introduction to the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput sequence data using R and Bioconductor.

* Day 1 focuses on learning essential background: an introduction to the R programming language; central concepts for effective use of Bioconductor software; and an overview of high-throughput sequence analysis work flows.
* Day 2 emphasizes use of Bioconductor for specific tasks: an RNA-seq differential expression work flow; exploratory, machine learning, and other statistical tasks; gene set enrichment; and annotation.
* Day 3 transitions to understanding effective approaches for managing larger challenges: strategies for working with large data, writing re-usable functions, developing reproducible reports and work flows, and visualizing results.

The course combines lectures with extensive hands-on practicals; students are required to bring a laptop with wireless internet access and a modern version of the Chrome or Safari web browser.
