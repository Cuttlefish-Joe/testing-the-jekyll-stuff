I researched and counted all the HTML tags, so you don't have to count them yourself.

Recently, I have been wondering how many HTML tags exist. I searched online, like you but I could not find an exact answer. I wrote this article as a final answer to that question.

For purpose of this report, a html tag can be self-closing single tag <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> or a pair of HTML tags <code>&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.

## My approach: Check 5 HTML reference websites.
For my source, I chose 5 websites that are mostly used as references for developers. These are:
HTML.com, Yourhtmlsource.com, Mozilla Developer Network(MDN), HtmlReference.io, and W3schools.com.  

### Total Number of HTML tags

|-------------|--------|
|Reference Website|Total number of HTML tags|
|Mozilla Developer Network(MDN) | 142 |
|HTML.com | 132 |
|W3schools.com | 119 | 
|Eastmanreference.com |115 |
|Htmlreference.io | 113 |
|Yourhtmlsource.com | 69 |

### Current usable HTML tags
These HTML tags are part of the current version of HTML(HTML5).

|Reference Website|Total number Supported HTML tags|
| Mozilla Developer Network(MDN) | 111 |
| Htmlreference.io | 113 |
| W3schools.com |107 |

### Depracated HTML tags
These are HTML tags that are not supported by the HTML standards. They used to be there but some times ago but they were removed from the current version of HTML- HTML5.

|Reference Website|Total number Unsupported HTML tags|
| Mozilla Developer Network(MDN) | 31 |
| html.com | 19 |
| W3schools.com |12 |


Since you already know what HTML tags are, you can go ahead and [create your first webpage using HTML](/create-a-web-page-using-html/).
