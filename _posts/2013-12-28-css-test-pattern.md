HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). Of all the tags **&lt;STRONG&gt;** and *&lt;EM&gt;* are the most common along with their older cousins <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> and <i>&lt;i&gt;</i>. The `<code>` tag is also pretty common. Less common are the <small>&lt;small&gt;</small>, <abbr>&lt;abbr&gt;</abbr> and <cite>&lt;cite&gt;</cite> tags. <del>&lt;del&gt;</del> and <s>&lt;s&gt;</s> are used to represent text that has been deleted or stricken through. while <ins>&lt;INS&gt;</ins> is used to mark inserted text. You can even represent superscripts with the <sup>&lt;sup&gt;</sup> tag and subscripts withe the <sub>&lt;sub&gt;</sub> tag.
