title: Galaxy overview

[Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org/) is the definitive workflow platform for computational biology.
It features a web-based graphical user interface that makes powerful analyses possible without doing computer programming.
I've collected some resources that may be useful for people starting from scratch, as well as describe a little at the end about our local Galaxy instance that can submit jobs to our own cluster.

The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_(computational_biology)">Galaxy Wikipedia page</a>
is a good place to start if you don't know anything about Galaxy.
[Galaxy 101](http://usegalaxy.org/galaxy101) is the first tutorial to follow.
There are lots of screencasts out there that show how to use Galaxy, however it's important to note that only the screencasts on the [Galaxy Vimeo channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/usegalaxy) are up to date.

This learning resources video gives an overview of Galaxy's wiki and public server education.

They point you to the [published pages](https://usegalaxy.org/page/list_published) and in particular the [Galaxy exercises](https://usegalaxy.org/u/james/p/exercises), as well as the [wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) with its [list of learning resources](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn).

Our Galaxy instance is at <http://shapley.fhcrc.org/>.
In addition to some tools we have put together for FHCRC use, we also have imported a number of tools that were of interest to FHCRC scientists.
If what you see there doesn't meet your needs, take a look at the [Galaxy toolshed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) and [its documentation](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/ToolShed).
If you find a tool there that we don't have yet, let Erick know and we'll work to make it available for you to use.
