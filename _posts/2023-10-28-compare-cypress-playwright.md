title: Getting hands on with test tools- Cypress versus Playwright
---

<i>This post will give some practical advice on installing [Cypress](#-setting-up-cypress-and-run-tests) and [Playwright](#-set-up-playwright-and-run-tests) to create and run some simple UI tests, and [a brief comparison](#-summary) between the two tools.</i>

Alongside Selenium, Cypress and Playwright are currently amongst the most widely used test automation tools. There is a lot of discussion about the pros and cons of each tool, which is the most suitable for a given project etc. but you may want to try these tools out for yourself, this post will help you to get up and running, and run some basic UI tests.

To evaluate these tools myself, I set up [a Git repo](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests) to do some basic UI automation, one using Cypress the other Playwright to compare them side by side (I will add Selenium Webdriver soon). If you can set up these tools locally, you will be able to follow and implement the simple test plan outlined below, or alternatively clone the material in the repo itself and run it.

### Test Plan

To compare these test tools, I used the [5W](https://testiotech.com/2024/01/26/5W-Framework/) approach in ChatGPT to come up with this outline of a test scope:

<ul>
<li>Page Loads: Ensure that specified page load correctly.</li>
<li>Navigation: Verify the navigation within the web shop.</li>
<li>Registered User Login: Test the login process for registered users.</li>
<li>Add to Basket and Checkout: Check the functionality of adding items to the basket and completing the checkout process.</li>
</ul>

The system under test used here ([https://www.demoblaze.com]https://www.demoblaze.com)) has proven to be really useful for e-commerce type testing, but you of course may have a preferred alternative (generally we'll be covering an e-commerce transactions).

### Setting up Cypress and run tests

The documentation on installing Cypress itself is pretty user friendly, so rather than repeat material this section will highlight some of the key areas.

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements

Tip: if on running 'npx cypress open' you see a 'Cypress Configuration Error', ensure you are running cypress from the right folder level, it needs to be in a folder above the cypress.config.js level to avoid any config errors.
<image: cypress config error>

Provided the installation has been successful, my prefered approach is to open a command line/terminal in the project folder, and run:

{% highlight js %}
npx cypress open
{% endhighlight %}

This should open up the Cypress Launchpad, and for this post we'll be concentrating on E2E testing (to cover an e-commerce system).

Once cypress is up and running in the browser, my approach was to follow the Getting Started page to set up the first 'E2E' test, and build on that to start covering the project plan:

[https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test(https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)]

#### Setting the baseURL

For UI tests its very useful to not have to explicitly use the url of the system under test (e.g. www.demoblaze.com). We can define the baseUrl in the cypress.config.js in project root. Cypress calls this base url when '/' is used in an E2E test, e.g.

{% highlight js %}
cy.visit('/') // uses the baseUrl ("www.demoblaze.com in our example) in the cypress.config to open the url.
{% endhighlight %}

#### Fixtures

A lot of the UI tests in this plan use the same user details info for each test, and rather than repeat those strings in each test, we can define a fixture file to store all our log in data, and reuse it in each test.

#### Example:

In the fixtures file, the userDetails class contains user log in details:

{% highlight js %}
{
"username": "test",
"password": "test",
"welcomeText": "Welcome test",
"name": "Sid Spendalot",
"country": "UK",
"city": "Testville",
"creditCard": "554433221",
"month": "April",
"year": "2023"
}
{% endhighlight %}

This class is used in E2E tests, e.g. in E2EloginPurchases test file, we get the fixture file:

{% gist 2febfb086c687c0939edf2f1551e847b %}

..and from that line on we can use the details from the fixture file in the test (i.e. the E2E test class is getting the userDetails.password & userDetails.username are those defined in the fixture file):

{% gist dc6175465df73d5c706268bf8add1429 %}

In addition to Cypress documentation, this blog proved useful in understand more about Cypress Fixtures:
[https://testersdock.com/cypress-fixtures/(https://testersdock.com/cypress-fixtures/)]

#### Time Travel

The time travel feature is effectively a record of the changing state of the system under test, which has proven to be invaluable to understand how the website behaves in response to our test inputs, and to debug.

Lets us the demonstrate this by looking at an E2E test that uses our baseUrl set in config, and some of our imported fixture data.

##### Example

The [E2Eloginpurchases](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/cypress/e2e/E2EloginPurchases.cy.js) E2E test verifies the log in process works with a valid username/password, and checks a successful log in message appears on screen.

![Passing E2E run in Cypress browser view](/images/1_test_passes.png)

In the spec window of Cypress browser we can see our test code has used our configured baseURL and knows '/' should be 'www.demoblaze.com', and uses the imported config to pass in userName & userPassword.

![Passing E2E run in Cypress browser view](/images/2_travel_back.png)

On the successful run, we can see the test step to verify a message appears on screen 'Welcome <user name>' ('Welcome test' in this case):

![Passing E2E run in Cypress browser view](/images/3_loggedIn.png)

The advantage of time travel is that it makes it really convenient and efficient to check the variables we're passing in, and how the system behaves. If we have a failing test, we can efficiently debug by 'travelling' to the steps in question. In the example below, the test step expects a different user name to what's being passed on screen.

![Passing E2E run in Cypress browser view](/images/4_failed_test.png)

The failed step is identified and we can have a closer look at exactly what was happening at that point on the system under test.

### Cypress - Summary

In summary, the Cypress documentation allows us to get up and running pretty quickly, and the example given of setting up the first test allows us to build up the test plan. In the post we had a quick look at setting a base url and test config, and I personally I was impressed with the [time travel feature]- {#cypress_page_locator}some of the page elements on the system under test were difficult to identify in javascript, the time travel showed the exact stage and screen where the issues were, which was invaluable when it came to debugging.

## Set up Playwright and run tests

<i> This is a rough guide to get up and running (follow the links for more detailed instruction) and we'll use the same test plan as mentioned in Test Plan.</i>

### Installation

<i>Note: you will need to have have NPM installed.</i>

I recommend creating a folder structure via Visual Studio Code, see [Automating End-to-End testing with Playwright and Azure Pipelines](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-architecture-blog/automating-end-to-end-testing-with-playwright-and-azure/ba-p/3883704).

Once the structure is in place the guide is straightforward, note the step 6 'Execute Playwright Test Script' would not work for me, my solution was change directly (in Terminal) to my playwright folder, the run: npm init playwright@latest

To run directly in VSC, you need to install playwright extension, as per:
[https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode#installation](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode#installation).

Once installed you should see a green run icon in the test spec window:
![VSC run icon](/images/VSC_pw_run_icon.png)

### Create tests

The initial set up of Playwright helpfully includes a file called [tests/example.spec.ts](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/tests/demo.spec.ts), this gives us a solid example to explain how the tool works, and I used this to build up the test scope.

{% highlight js %}
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

// Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

// Click the get started link.
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();

// Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});

{% endhighlight js %}

To run tests, use the following command in either VSC or the command line/terminal.
{% highlight js %}
npx playwright test --

{% endhighlight js %}

### Playwright codegen

Playwright has an impressive feature to record script automatically called Codegen. In theory it can record the whole log in, add item to basket etc. steps for us, but I found it more useful to find those page elements which were [awkward to find and use in Cypress.](cypress_page_locator)
For example, if we run the following command, the specified website and Playwright inspector will load up.

{% highlight js %}
npx playwright codegen browserstack.com
{% endhighlight js %}

We can undertake our actions on the website, e.g. lets click log in, and input a user name and password. As you can see in the clip below, the user actions in the browser is tracked in the Playwright Inspector, so we can see the locators, tags and roles etc.

<iframe width="427" height="240" src="/images/PW_Codegen.mp4" title="Codegen with browser and inspector windows" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In my experience, it didn't quite capture the whole test code I needed, but it definitely saved time in getting the right elements.

Browerstack has a useful summary here: [www.browserstack.com/guide/playwright-debugging/](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/playwright-debugging#:~:text=Playwright%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,the%20headful%20mode%20for%20tests)

### Authenticated log in state

Rather than have to repeat the log in steps explicitly for each test that requires a logged in user (e.g. adding items to cart and checking out), its possible to save the 'logged in state' to a setting in the [.config.ts file](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/playwright/.auth/user.json):

{% highlight js %}
storageState: "playwright/.auth/user.json"
{% endhighlight js %}

This object points at [auth.setup](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/tests/auth.setup.ts) (which is in the testDir location specified in the config). This file is effectively the successful log in test, and writes its logged in state back to the user.json file configured in playwright.config:

{% highlight js %}
await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile });
{% endhighlight js %}

Now, by importing the Test class, the logged in state is used, i.e. each test which imports this class is in a logged state as a begin action.

If you want to see this applied, see the [auth.setup](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/tests/auth.setup.ts) file in playwright/tests, and the [user.json](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/playwright/.auth/user.json) in playwright/playwright/.auth, or checkout this helpful write up: [https://www.cuketest.com/playwright/docs/auth/](https://www.cuketest.com/playwright/docs/auth/)

### Traceviewer

Traceviewer allows us to review a record of completed tests, similar in a way to Cypress Time travel (which we looked at previously), it reports the test result and allows us to check the outcome of each test step. The benefits here are for reporting itself, and when necessary for debugging, we can review a failed test and see exactly where/why it failed the given test step.

To enable traceviewer, we need the following value in the [config](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/playwright.config.ts) file.

{% highlight js %}
/_ Collect trace when retrying the failed test. See https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer _/
trace: "on-first-retry
{% endhighlight js %}

Lets demonstrate how to use traceviewer by change one of our passing tests so it fails. In [login.steps](https://github.com/dp2020-dev/blazemeter-ecommerce-automated-tests/blob/main/playwright/tests/login.spec.ts) , the expected log in message is <b>'Welcome test'</b> (test being the username), changed to <b>'Welcome visitor'</b>:

{% highlight js %}
test.describe("Log in tests", () => {
test("Successful log", async ({ page }) => {
const loginPage = new login(page);
await loginPage.initializeLocators();
await loginPage.loginFunction("test", "test");
await expect(
page.getByRole("link", { name: "Welcome visitor" })
).toBeVisible();
{% endhighlight js %}

To run traceviewer, go to the command line/terminal and input:
{% highlight js %}
npx playwright test login.spec.ts:10 --trace on
{% endhighlight js %}
This runs traceviewer for the specified test.

![Traceviewer running](/images/traceviewer1.png/)

Traceviewer saves the test run in a zip file, you can also view it in the browser, for example:
{% highlight js %}
Serving HTML report at http://localhost:57023. Press Ctrl+C to quit.
{% endhighlight js %}

![Traceviewer test steps and traces](/images/Traceviewer2.png)

The test report shows us the failing test, and clicking trace allows us to see screenshots of each test step. We can see that the message on screen is 'Welcome test' not 'Welcome visitor'.

![Traceviewer screenshots of failed test step](/images/Traceviewer3.png)

This is a really good explanation and summary of Traceviewer, from the official Playwright channel:

<iframe width="427" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfxjs--9ZQs" title="Viewing Playwright traces" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Summary - Playwright

I found Playwright relatively straightforward to get up and running quickly, and am impressed by the utility and intuitiveness of codegen and traceviewer. We use a simple example [above](#traceviewer) for traceviewer but it definitely enables quick and effective reporting and debugging, and the codegen tool did help in finding the more awkward page elements which were more difficult in Cypress.

# Cypress versus Playwright

I have more experience in using Selenium than these tools, so this was an interesting exercise for me to see how 'lightweight' and quick to implement and use these were in comparison on Selenium. I feel I was able to get Playwright up and running in less time than Cypress, but both are perhaps more user friendly than Selenium.

However, there are a few considerations here, both tools have implicit waits, i.e. a test step will wait fot an element to be loaded before proceeding. This obviously has the advantage of making a test more reliable, but what if this implicit wait is not what the end user expects? Selenium does not have this default wait, it can be added manually but is an interesting consideration.
