### **Session 1:** *Mondays from August 15 - September 26, 2016 in M4-A823, 2:00 - 4:00 pm*

### **Session 2:** *Mondays from October 3 - November 14, 2016 in M4-A823, 2:00 - 4:00 pm*

Register for either session [here](https://goo.gl/forms/2r2nGlJGzoLJ7xZz2).

This series of seven two-hour classes will be a gentle introduction to the art of Bioinformatics.
Registration above is for all seven classes, and is offered only to students, faculty and staff of the Fred Hutch.

Students will obtain a big-picture understanding of how to approach computational analyses, and through practical examples begin developing the specific skills and knowledge needed to carry out such analyses on their own.
No prior technical or computational experience is required, though students with previous experience may benefit from the course's high-level perspective.

The course will consist of seven two-hour classes (including 1/2 hour of in class problem solving), as follows:

1. Overview & remote server access
2. Unix Shell I - overview & stdin/stdout
3. Unix Shell II - scripting & other utils
4. Version Control with Git
5. Python I - syntax and data types
6. Python II - building data structures
7. Python III - writing a program

The curriculum will be drawn from the book *Bioinformatics Data Skills*, which will be available throughout the class free of cost.
Students will be encouraged to do a couple hours of reading and/or homework between sessions in order to get the most out of their time.
