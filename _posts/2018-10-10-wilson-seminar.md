[fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io) and the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data 
Science Cooperative ([The Coop](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/bdsc.html)) 
are pleased to present a special seminar next Monday, Oct 9 at 3:30 pm in Yale J5-321. 
Greg Wilson, data scientist and professional educator at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/about/) 
and co-founder of [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org), will be sharing his 
experiences in building community support for computational training. Greg’s visit is 
fortuitously timed to coordinate with increasing support for data science here at the 
Hutch. We hope you’ll join us to learn more about how we might increase computational 
training and capacity across campus. For questions, please contact 
[Kate Hertweck](khertwec@fredhutch.org).
