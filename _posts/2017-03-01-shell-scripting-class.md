### *2:30pm Wednesday, March 15nd in Pelton*

Shell scripts are very handy to automate tasks on the command line. In
this workshop we will present shell scripting not as a general-purpose
programming language, but one that is best understood and used as a
means of assembling and composing executables. By Erick Matsen.

The course will be discussion and demonstration by Erick Matsen, and will be followed up with an office hour at 2:30 Wednesday, March 22nd in M1-A303 if you want help using or setting up the tools demonstrated during the talk.
