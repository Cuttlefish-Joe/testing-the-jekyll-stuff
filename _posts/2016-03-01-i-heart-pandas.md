### **1st class:** *9-10am Tues March 1st (Erick Matsen): Jupyter & Python (optional)*

### **2nd class:** *9-10am Tues March 8th (Jake VanderPlas): pandas*

Modern biology generates a lot of data, sometimes more than can be comfortably processed with a spreadsheet program.
This workshop will get you started with the pandas data analysis library for Python.
We will be using the web-based Jupyter interactive computing environment, newly available on the Fred Hutch network.
These classes will assume proficiency with computer programming in some language.
Attendees must bring a laptop to the course.

Jake VanderPlas is the Director of Research in Physical Sciences at the UW eScience Institute.
He is a contributor to the Scikit-Learn package and creator of the mpld3 package.
