This seven-week course will be a gentle introduction to Python.  We'll cover the following topics:

- Data types: scalars, lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Reading and writing files
- Flow of control 
- Modularizing code by writing functions
- Data wrangling with pandas
- Basic data visualization with seaborn
- Where to find help beyond google: help(), dir(), stackoverflow, pycon and PuPPy
- Introduction to Github for code sharing and collaboration

Attendees must bring a laptop with Anaconda (or miniconda) installed (https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Please make sure have an interactive Jupyter notebook in your PC, where we will write and run one ton of fun Python code. Using Python 3.x (E.g. 3.6) is highly recommended. 
Please be sure your laptop can connect to the Marconi on-campus wireless network prior to the class.
