Thanks for visiting my small corner of the internet. 

### About me 

A systems/software engineer. I currently live in Kirkland, WA with my wonderful wife.

I am currently ramping up my interview preparation as I am pursuing opportunities in core distributed systems and software engineering related roles.

When I am not building and testing software and networks, I like to indulge with a vast variety of interests and passions.

### Stuff I try and improve myself in 

* Algorithm and Data Structures (Thats the bread and butter)
* Building Scalable systems(Some more bread and butter)
* Chess (currently aspiring for a 1500 FIDE rating)
* Science Education (Teaching Science and programming is fun!)
* Classical Music (Learning a violin is hard)
* Astrophotography (Who knew trying to sit still for hours would be so much fun)
* Amatuer astronomy (I know a few constellations and celestial bodies)
