title: Getting started with R
---

We had a great office hour yesterday, and we talked some about R, so I thought I would summarize that interaction in a short post.

If you haven't used R before and are new to programming, a good place to start is the [Codeschool R starter course](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
If you are an experienced programmer but want an overview of the language, you can't do better than the [R intro](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html) that comes with R itself.
Also, [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) is developed by Martin Morgan and his core of programmers here at the FHCRC, so there are lots of knowledgeable folks around.

Other handy R sites include the [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) site and the [list of resources compiled by RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/help_with_r).
Hadley Wickham is putting together a great-looking [Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), including a list of what he views as essential R [vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html).

Check out [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), even if you are fanatical about your text editor.
You can use RStudio to make nice [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) reports using a combination of R and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
RStudio has [a page on R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown) to get started, or you can see this movie from the author of knitr:
