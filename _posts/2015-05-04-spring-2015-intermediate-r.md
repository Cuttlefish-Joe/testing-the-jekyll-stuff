### Jerry Davison, FHCRC Genomics & Bioinformatics Shared Resource

### **Day 1 class date:** *Monday May 4 in M1-A303, 9:00am - 1:00pm*

### **Day 2 class date:** *Monday May 11 in M1-A303, 9:00am - 1:00pm*


The FHCRC Genomics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource is presenting a
short course over two half-days at the FHCRC Day Campus teaching
aspects of computing with R. Registration is now open, attendance is
limited to FHCRC faculty, staff and students, and Cancer Consortium
and UW CFAR members.

The course is intended for scientists who are familiar with and
comfortable using R; class members will use their personal laptops to
access high-performance computers and work with example data. No
credits are offered for this free and informal course.

Topics covered:

- Day 1, efficient R programming considerations and measuring
  performance; warning, errors and debugging; high-performance Linux
  computers, common Linux commands, using multiple cores to speed
  execution. For the FHCRC attendees we will cover the computing
  resources provided by the Hutch scientific computing group. We
  present in-class exercises and discuss your solutions.

- Day 2, an introduction to RNA-seq analysis: experiment design,
  sequencing and alignment, counting reads, organizing the
  datasets. Normalization, filtering, calculating differential
  representation, and assessing per-gene statistical
  significance. Abundant in-class exercises.
