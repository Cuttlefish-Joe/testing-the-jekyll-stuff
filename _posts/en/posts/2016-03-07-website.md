As you can see we just launched our full site, complete with pages and everything. (~Â´o`)~

You can stay updated via our [newsletter](#newsletter) or the [Atom feed](/atom.xml).

But that's not all: Not only did we update the site but we also published our open call for submissions and suggestions for the festival. If you have a game you would like to have included in the exhibition, or if you are interested in doing a talk or a performance, let us know!
