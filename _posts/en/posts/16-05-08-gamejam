Hey peeps,

it's time to announce our gamejam and tell you some detailed information:

The jam is happening on 22nd of May, starting around 11:00am CEST and going to finish at 5:00pm.
We thought of it as an relaxed space, an opportunity for everyone who likes to join and try what they have in mind.
This can be everything as far as your intrepretation of games go, sculptures, performance, cargames or a classic 2d platformer.
If skilled or not, everyone is invited and we are happy for each one trying.
Go as group or be the single operating ninja you always wanted to be.

On the festival ground will be an area prepared for you, if you don't have the tools (like a portable pc) but would like to join - get in touch with us and we will try to supply you for that specific time.

There also will be a theme and you can suggest ideas for it until 22nd, 10:am, via twitter where the voting will start at that time as well.
You don't have to be on twitter though to do this, you can mail us your favourite theme as well via email or at the festival space the days before.

Though gamejams can be heavy energy-costly this hasn't to be the norm and there isn't the need for finishing as well.
It shall be a room for experimentation where yourself are the boss and you can set the tempo for your project - if fast as light or laidback sloth style.

I hope you are fine with that, suggestions on the whole event are welcomed as well, and we are a few at the end.

Oh, and we plan to have a small itch.io site on time, so for all those who don't want to participate in developing but playing is an opportunity given as well (only if the developers are fine with that though).

So, let's have fun (until then & then) :}
