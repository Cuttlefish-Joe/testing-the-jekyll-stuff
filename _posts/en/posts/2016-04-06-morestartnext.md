Hey lovely people,

as you might have already seen, our crowdfunding campaign sadly did not reach its goal.
We received loads of support in the last couple of days (which is super cool!) but in the end we were still quite a bit off from our funding target.

There might be some room to reflect on our campaign or crowdfunding in general, but for now we just wanted to thank all of you for trying to throw your money at us!!


As we already said many times tinypalace will happen no matter what. We're currently scraping our spare change together and hope to see you all in May!!


hugs and kisses,
nicole and the other tiny collective peeps


PS: If you are still interested in pretty bags and usb accessories we might still make a couple for the festival ;)
