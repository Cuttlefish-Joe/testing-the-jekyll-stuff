We are committed to making tinypalace a safe, respectful and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, socioeconomic or educational background or level of experience.

We do not tolerate abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior such as

- Use of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory language or imagery
- Insulting, violence, threats of violence or stalking
- Inappropriate or non-consenting physical contact
- Photography or recording of people without their prior consent
- Sustained or willful disruption of the exhibition, talks or other events

or making people feel unsafe or unwelcome at our festival in any other way.

We encourage you to help us make tinypalace a positive, supportive and overall cool place for everyone involved. If you notice anything disruptive or if you see someone being uncomfortable or in distress please don't hesitate to ask them if they need help or let us know.

Please also contribute to a respectful and responsible dialog. Check in and provide <span class="help" title='Example: "Trigger warning, during my presentation I will also talk about explicit violence and homophobic language"'>warnings</span> before discussing topics that may be <span class="help" title="Triggers can be certain topics, words or images, that may evoke negative associations and memories for people with - often traumatic - experiences">triggering</span> during talks or other events.

We expect everyone to respect and adhere to these guidelines, including all members and volunteers of tinypalace. We may ask anyone to leave the festival if their behaviour violates this policy or is harmful in any way.

Please tell us if you are feeling uncomfortable or unsafe for any reason. You can write us (anonymously, if you want) at:

NOTE REGARDING TOILETS: We can only provide a unisex toilet space. If you don't feel comfortable with that there are also seperated toilets at the train station Kassel Hauptbahnhof (right around the corner). Unfortunately some of them require a fee and they are not part of the festival area.

NOTE REGARDING MINORS: There may be works or talks depicting violence, sexuality or other topics that some may not find appropriate for children. Therefore we can only grant admission to the festival to people under the age of 18 if they are accompanied by a person of full age (like a parental figure for example).
