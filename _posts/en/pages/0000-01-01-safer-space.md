We feel that a lot of game-related events and festivals only include anti-harassment policies on a superfical level (if they include them at all) and are often lackluster in their ability to ensure a safe and positive space for everyone participating.

Therfore we are committed to making tinypalace a safe, respectful and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, socioeconomic or educational background or level of experience.

We do not tolerate abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior such as

- Use of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory language or imagery
- Insulting, violence, threats of violence or stalking
- Inappropriate or non-consenting physical contact
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained or willful disruption of the exhibition, talks or other events

or making people feel unsafe or unwelcome at our festival in any other way.

We encourage you to help us making tinypalace a positive, supportive and overall cool place for everyone involved. If you notice anything abusive or disruptive or if you see someone being uncomfortable or in distress please ask them if they need help or let us know.

Please also contribute to a respectful and responsible dialog. Check in and provide warnings before discussing topics that may be triggering during talks or other events.

We expect everyone to respect and adhere to these guidelines, including all members and volunteers of tinypalace. We may ask anyone to leave the festival if their behaviour violates this policy or is harmful in any way.

Please tell us if you are feeling uncomfortable or unsafe for any reason. You can also write us (anonymously, if you want) at:
