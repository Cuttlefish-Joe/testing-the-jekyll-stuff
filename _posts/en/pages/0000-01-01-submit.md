While we are doing a lot of research for tinypalace, regarding the games we want to give a platform to and the topics we want to discuss, we're sure that there are a lot of people out there we just don't know (yet) but have something important to say and show.  
Let's be honest, we're also pretty new to this.

Therefore we are putting out this open call in the hopes that we get a lot of diverse and cool people to give us their perspectives.

We are currently looking for submissions or suggestions for talks, workshops, performances and games.  
But we're pretty much open to anything. So let's hear your ideas.

[Submit a talk, workshop or other panel!]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-program)

[Submit a game for the exhibition!]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit-game)

If you have any other questions regarding submissions (or if you don't like forms) you can write us at <a href='mailt&#111;&#58;ti&#110;%7&#57;p&#97;lace&#64;p%&#54;F&#37;7&#51;&#37;7&#52;&#101;&#111;&#46;&#100;e'>tin<span style="display:none">REMOVETHIS</span>ypala&#99;e&#64;post&#101;o&#46;d&#101;</a>.
