### *Friday, November 20, 2015 in M1-A307, 1:00 - 3:00 pm*

[Galaxy](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) is a popular web-based platform for performing complex and reproducible computational biology analyses with no computer programming, and we're happy to be able to provide [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org) on the Hutch internal network for use by Fred Hutch researchers and affiliates.

RNA-seq has become a standard assay in molecular biology, and Galaxy has a comprehensive set of tools to help you learn from the results.
This hands-on workshop for Fred Hutch employees and affiliates is an introduction to RNA-seq differential expression analysis using Galaxy, including:

- Performing basic quality control
- Mapping reads to a reference genome
- Assembling transcripts
- Quantifying differentially-expressed transcripts

Attendees must bring a laptop to the course, but we'll provide the pizza.
Please use your fredhutch.org or affiliate email address when registering!

Register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rna-seq-differential-expression-analysis-using-galaxy-registration-19179369009).
Registration is limited to 15 participants.
If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list &mdash; please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to plan future workshop sessions.
