[Galaxy](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) is an increasingly popular web-based platform for performing complex and reproducible computational biology analyses with no computer programming.
Though the original public Galaxy server, [Galaxy Main](http://usegalaxy.org), is free and open to the public, it cannot scale to meet everyone's needs.
Contention for computational resources among its thousands of users can lead to long wait times, and its data storage quotas can prohibit some types of analyses.
Consequently, many institutions around the world have made Galaxy available to their researchers locally, using their own computational resources and storage.
We're happy to be able to provide [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org) on the Hutch internal network for use by Fred Hutch researchers and affiliates.

RNA-seq has become a standard assay in molecular biology, and Galaxy has a comprehensive set of tools to help you learn from the results.
This hands-on workshop for Fred Hutch employees and affiliates is an introduction to RNA-seq differential expression analysis using Galaxy, including:

- Performing basic quality control
- Mapping reads to a reference genome
- Assembling transcripts
- Quantifying differentially-expressed transcripts

Attendees must bring a laptop to the course, but we'll provide the pizza.
Please use your fredhutch.org or affiliate email address when registering!

Register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rna-seq-differential-expression-analysis-using-galaxy-registration-19179369009).
Registration is limited to 15 participants.
If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list &mdash; please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to plan future workshop sessions.
