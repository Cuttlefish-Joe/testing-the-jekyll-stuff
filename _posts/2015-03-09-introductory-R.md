The FHCRC Genomics & Bioinformatics Shared Resource is presenting a free introductory short course teaching the R computing language; the material is the same as the introductory course we taught last year. The course is intended for scientists who are familiar with and comfortable using spreadsheet applications like Excel or OpenOffice to produce and work with data tables; but who have no or little experience with R. Attendance is limited to FHCRC faculty and staff and Cancer Consortium and UW CFAR members.

Why R? Spreadsheet applications and the R language complement each other; instructors will explain step-by-step the transfer of data tables from spreadsheet to the R environment and back. Class members will use their personal computers to begin using R and work with example data, so you need to bring a laptop to class. Examples will address common analysis issues, including microarray and sequencing data.

Course classes will be held on the FHCRC Day Campus this March 9, 16, 23 and April 1. Material in later class sessions builds on the earlier ones, sessions do not repeat material. No credits are offered for this free and informal course.

R (see <http://cran.fhcrc.org>) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics; it has integrated facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display; tabular data can be dealt with in both everyday and more sophisticated ways; tables can be subset and columns combined, and numerical values processed; statistical hypothesis tests can be run and plots made on-screen or saved in a number of common file formats.
