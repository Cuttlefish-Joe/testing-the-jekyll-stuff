### Mary Goldman, UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser Team
### *Thursday, April 23, 2015 in D1-080/084, 12:00 - 3:00 pm*

[UCSC Xena](http://xena.ucsc.edu/) is a tool that allows researchers to easily and securely view both their own cancer genomics data and data from large consortiums, such as TCGA.
During this hands on workshop we will:

1. view data from TCGA, Pediatric Cancer, and CCLE

1. view various -omic data types in a spreadsheet-like view, including positional mutation data, copy number variation, gene and exon expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression, as well as phenotype and clinical data such as age and subtype

1. dynamically generate KM plots, bar graphs and scatter plots

1. view mutations on 3D protein structures

We will show participants how to view their own private data by downloading our click-and-run application, loading data into it, and then viewing the data on our website.
We have also integrated our tool with Galaxy to assist those users who may not have a strong computer background or those who wish to ensure data provenance.

*Attendees must bring a laptop to the course*, but we'll provide the pizza.

Registration is limited to 40 participants; please register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ucsc-cancer-genomics-browser-workshop-registration-16388650896). 

If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list -- please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to gauge interest in future sessions.
