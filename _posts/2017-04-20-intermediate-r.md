### *Thursdays from April 20 &ndash; June 1, 2017*

#### *2:00 &ndash; 4:00 pm*

This seven-week course will be an intermediate level series on the R programming language.
We'll cover the following topics:

- Data manipulation with dplyr
- Programming in R
- The “apply” functions
- Parallelization and efficiency
- Tools for reproducibility
- Reporting with R Markdown

Teaching programming solely via lectures can be difficult, because programming really isn't a spectator sport.
The primary means of instruction will be through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), a service which offers interactive, browser-based courses in R.
DataCamp is a good way for participants to learn interactively, at their own pace, with instant feedback for each exercise.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, we encourage you to make a DataCamp account and try out the first chapter of the "Intermediate R" course.
If it leaves you wanting more, sign up for this seven-week course by following the registration link below!
Full access to DataCamp will be provided to students for the duration of the course.

This course is open to Fred Hutch faculty, staff, and affiliates.
Students must bring a laptop to each class.
Please be sure your laptop can connect to the Marconi on-campus wireless network prior to the first class.

Register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intermediate-r-tickets-33510226991).
Please register using your Fred Hutch (or affiliate) email address so that we may verify your eligibility for the course.

Registration for each seven-week session is limited to 15 participants.
If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list &mdash; please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to plan future sessions.
