Yes, you can learn HTML without having to go to a college or a boot camp. In fact, you can learn HTML at the comfort of your own home. However, you will need learning materials to enable you to learn effectively.

Fortunately, there are a lot of websites and online courses that can help you learn. All you will need is a computer and some internet connection. You will then use these online resources for your lessons and practice. That is how I was able to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Why should you teach yourself HTML

  - you can <strong>easily access</strong> the resources <strong>online</strong>.
  - you <strong>save your time</strong>. You study when you have the time and don't have to commute to class.<br /> 
  - you <strong>save your money</strong>. The courses are available online for free or a fraction of the amount you would pay for a college course.

## How can you learn HTML without going to school?

There are many ways in which you can learn HTML. These are:

  1. ###  Watching Youtube video courses.

There are a lot of guys who have created great youtube channels to teach you and me how to make websites. And they teach basic and advanced HTML skills.

There are many youtube video courses that can teach you HTML. If you learn well by listening and watching, you will find video courses enjoyable. Some of the courses I have taken is the <a href="https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE">HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners</a> By <a href="https://www.udemy.com/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/#instructor-1">Brad Traversy</a>

    <h3>
      Taking an online course.
    </h3>
  </li>
</ol>

You can learn HTML by taking an online course that teaches HTML skill. There are many free and paid course. For now, I would recommend sticking to the most popular online courses. These are:

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <h3>
      Reading HTML reference guides.
    </h3>
  </li>
</ol>

After taking your first few lessons, you will encounter a situation where your code does not work as you expect. Use the HTML references to troubleshoot your code.

- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla MDN reference</a>
- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">W3schools reference</a>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <h3>
      Learn-Search-Ask Learning method
    </h3>
  </li>
</ol>

Sometimes when you get stuck, do a search on google what you are trying to accomplish. You will probably get an answer as soon as you ask.

### I am Stuck with HTML, What should I do?
If you come across a problem that you don't know the solution to while learning HTML, you can try the following solutions:
- Search online for a solution to your question.
- Join an active online forum: [FreeCodeCamp Forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org)
- Join a facebook group of fellow learners where you can ask questions.

### How to Choose good HTML Tutorial
When choosing a good HTML tutorial check to ensure that the course:
- is up to date.
- should be practical based learning.
- covers all the most used HTML tags.

## Practising what you have learnt.

After you have learnt the basics of HTML, its time to practice your newly acquired skill. To practice outside of the online editing tools, you will use a text editor to write your code and a browser to view the result.
