Yes, you can learn HTML without having to go to a college or a boot camp. In fact, you can learn HTML at the comfort of your own home. However, you will need learning materials to enable you to learn effectively.


Fortunately, there are a lot of websites and online courses that can help you learn. All you will need is a computer and some internet connection. You will then use these online resources for your lessons and practice. That is how I was able to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Why should you teach yourself HTML

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  a. you can <strong>easily access</strong> the resources <strong>online</strong>.<br /> b. you <strong>save your time</strong>. You study when you have the time and don&#8217;t have to commute to class.<br /> c. you <strong>save your money</strong>. The courses are available online for free or a fraction of the amount you would pay for a college course.
