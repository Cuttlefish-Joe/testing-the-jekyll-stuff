So, I finally did it.
I left WordPress.com and moved on... 

### What happened?
I've been wanting to move on to my own site for some time...
I came across [Barry Clark's artical in Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) regarding migrating from wordpress to jekyll + github pages.

### GitHub Pages - the revelation
GitHub pages? 
Aren't these the cool front pages of many projects I love? (i.e.[jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), etc...)
So I went to [github pages docs](https://pages.github.com/), and realized that this domain (+ hosting!) is free! for every github account!
*WOW!*
just watch the video...

### Jekyll - first ruby baby steps
But what is [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)?
Apparently, it is a simple Ruby framework that generate a (static) site from some content + templates. 
Something like one-time-compiled jsp...
I read a bit, and found [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html) and [jekyll-now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/), 2 *seed* projects that made to help you give birth...
Then I started looking for themes...
I found [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and I liked it.

### History - what about WordPress.com?
What about all my old posts?
There are several suggestions over the web, but I finally used a simple tool called [wpXml2Jekyll](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll), which transforms a wordpress xml into a list of jekyll md files.
Very recommended..

### So, what did I do?

- clone [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), a Poole theme.
- add my posts.
- add some tags - check out [Joe Kampschmidt post](https://www.jokecamp.com/blog/listing-jekyll-posts-by-tag/)
- add share buttons - check out [Kanishk Kunal post](https://superdevresources.com/share-buttons-jekyll/)
- add disqus integration - check out [DSQUS docs](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions)
- add next & prev buttons - check out [David Elbe post](http://david.elbe.me/jekyll/2015/06/20/how-to-link-to-next-and-previous-post-with-jekyll.html)
- play with intellij customization - check out [Hadi Hariri post](http://hadihariri.com/2014/01/04/using-webstorm-to-maintain-a-jekyll-site/)
- add google analytics - check out [Michael Lee post](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/)

### Show me the money... 
Well, since I didn't buy my own domain yet, it's free under \<username\>.github.io.
Total time invested in investigation and implementation: 2 days.

### What's next?
I don't know.
but I run my own site.
I can play with it.
And I will...
