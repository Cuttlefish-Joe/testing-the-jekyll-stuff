[Galaxy](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/) is an increasingly popular web-based platform for performing complex and reproducible computational biology analyses with no computer programming.
Though the original public Galaxy server, [Galaxy Main](http://usegalaxy.org), is free and open to the public, it cannot scale to meet everyone's needs.
Contention for computational resources among its thousands of users can lead to long wait times, and its data storage quotas can prohibit some types of analyses.
Consequently, many institutions around the world have made Galaxy available to their researchers locally, using their own computational resources and storage.
With the rollout of [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org), we are proud to add Fred Hutch to that list.

This course will be a gentle introduction to Galaxy for researchers with little or no prior experience.
By working through the [Galaxy 101 tutorial](https://usegalaxy.org/u/aun1/p/galaxy101), attendees will learn the basics of Galaxy, including:

- Fetching data from public sources
- Performing simple data manipulation
- Working with multiple histories
- Creating, editing, and running workflows

Attendees must bring a laptop to the course, but we'll provide the pizza.
To register, fill out the registration form [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L3V6NZY).
Registration is limited to 20 participants.

Want to try working through the tutorial on your own?
No problem!
Register an account using your fredhutch.org email address at [galaxy.fredhutch.org](http://galaxy.fredhutch.org) and give the [Galaxy 101 tutorial](https://usegalaxy.org/u/aun1/p/galaxy101) a try.
There's also a step-by-step [screencast](http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/galaxy101/).
