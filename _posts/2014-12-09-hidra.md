### Paul Fearn, Sarah Ramsay, and Adam Rauch

### *3:00 to 4:00 pm Tuesday, December 9th M4-A805/A817*


The Hutch Integrated Data Repository and Archive (HIDRA) is a multi-year initiative to bring together information about Cancer Consortium patients' clinical histories, biospecimens, studies and linked molecular or other assay data.
This resource will contain clinical data for an estimated 300,000 cancer related cases seen at UW Medicine and SCCA.


Consortium investigators will be able to browse and query these data through the Argos user interface, a set of secure data portals built with LabKey Server.


We will discuss the overall organization and roadmap for HIDRA, its current technical implementation on LabKey Server and SQL Server, and how to access HIDRA data directly through the Argos application or through Center IT Informatics services.
