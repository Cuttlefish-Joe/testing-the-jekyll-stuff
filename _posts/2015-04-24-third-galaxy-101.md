### *Friday, April 24, 2015 in M1-A303, 1:00 - 2:00 pm*

We've scheduled yet another Galaxy 101 class in late April!
This third session will cover the same topics as the first two; please see the [original announcement]({% post_url 2015-03-12-rollout-galaxy-101 %}) for more details.

As before, attendees must bring a laptop to the course, but we'll provide the pizza.
Please register via Eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/galaxyfredhutchorg-galaxy-101-registration-16344912072).
Registration is limited to 20 participants.
If the class is full, there will be an option to add yourself to the waiting list -- please do so if you're still interested!
We'll use the waiting list in case of cancellations and to plan future Galaxy 101 sessions.
