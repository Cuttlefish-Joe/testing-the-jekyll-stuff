title: Numeral Net - Tools and Resources
---

<div class="message">
  This post will cover the tools and resources that I found helpful in my week long foray into neural networks in Javascript.
</div>

The goal of Numeral Net was to train a neural network using the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a> of handwritten numbers to be able to take user input and deduce what number had been drawn on the web-page.


Here are some awesome resources that got me started:

* Hailey Foster has a [great overview](http://haileyfoster.com/Neural-Networks/) of JS libraries that helped us make an informed decision about which to pursue as well as a more in depth post on [implementing neural networks](http://haileyfoster.com/Impleneting-Neural-Networks) in JavaScript.
* In attempting to understand the big deal about machine learning and neural networks I came across an [awesome Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo) that details the importance of ML.
* Soon a need for a more technical and deep understanding of neural networks evolved and I found [this introduction](http://www.webpages.ttu.edu/dleverin/neural_network/neural_networks.html) to be digestible and packed full of information.

These are a few of the many places I found myself in pursuit of a deeper understanding of neural networks and the tools to implement on in JavaScript.
