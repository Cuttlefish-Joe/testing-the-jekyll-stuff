I believe it is so important to print your street photos, here's why.

1. Organisation - Depending on how much you shoot, storing and archiving your photographs can become a difficult task. Printing you photographs gives you an easy way to review the work you have done. 
2. Projects - Having printed copies of your work makes it super easy to arrange you photos for project selection. You can easily pin your images to a wall and arrange the order they may appear at a exhibition or for photobook publication.
3. Sharing - When you meet someone give them a print, its like a business card people can remember you by.
