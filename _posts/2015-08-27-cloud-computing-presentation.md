From Dirk Petersen, via the [scicomp-announce mailing list](https://lists.fhcrc.org/mailman/listinfo/scicomp-announce):


Fred Hutch Center Information Technology would like to invite you to a presentation we are organizing to share our research on the use of Cloud Computing here at the Center.
Over the past 6 months, our team has gained experience and confidence operating securely in a public cloud environment by exploring various use cases with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
We are developing a roadmap of how we might best use cloud services in the future to get additional capabilities, operational flexibility and the ability to quickly respond to emerging needs.

Please join us on **Thursday, August 27, 2015 from 1-3pm in M1-A303/305/307 (M Suites, Arnold Building)**.

We will have time to take questions following the presentation and welcome your feedback.
