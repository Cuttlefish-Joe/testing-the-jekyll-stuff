### Here are my 10 beginner tips for getting started in Street Photography

**1. Use the camera you have** - maybe its your phone, a DSLR, or a point a shoot. You don't need anything fancy to get started, just start shooting.
<p>
**2. Bring your camera everywhere** - things can happen so randomly on the street so if you have a camera with you everywhere you go, you'll never miss the opportunity to catch a unique moment. 
<p>
**3. Shoot Wide** - If you've been inspired by many of the classic masters of street photography you will most likely have been viewing images shot on a 28mm or 35mm lens. Aim to use this focal length it will force you to include more in your frame and tell more of the story of the street. 
<p>
**4. Get Closer** - Shooting with a wide angle lens like a 28mm will force you get closer to your subject. This is important in making your images feel intimate and real.
<p>
**5. Give yourself a project** - If you're finding it hard to concentrate or find anything to photograph, pick something simple to find on the street. Maybe you could spend one afternoon photographing people wearing hats. They don't have to be amazing photographs, but it will train you to search the scene for your next photograph. 
<p>
**6. Juxtapose** - One of the most important things I learnt early on in Street Photography, is to juxtapose your subjects. Think of it as contrasting two elements in a scene that even though they are unrelated, tell a new story. For example - A young mother pushing a pram, in the back ground we see poster for a nursing home. Maybe not the best example but it tells a story.
<p>
**7. Take notes** - Wether you are shooting digital or film, I think it can be useful to take notes of what image you seem to be drawn to taking. This can be an important process in the beginning as it will help you  find perhaps what your first project could be.
<p>
**8. Say Hello** - Be friendly, say hello to people on the street. A simple smile can defuse any potential altercations.
<p>
**9. Slow Down** - When I first started shooting street, I would walk so quickly around the streets, rushing to find the next shot. However I've found great success in taking it slow, walk slowly and wait for the shots to come to you.
<p>
**10. Stand Still** - Joel Meyerowitz recommends standing still. Wait on the  corner of a street, the point where two sidewalks combine brings opportunities. More people walking towards each other, there is a better dynamic.
