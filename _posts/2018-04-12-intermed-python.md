- Code Testing to ensure correctness
- Interactive Debugging to understand code failures
- Modules and Packaging to create reusable code

This course is open to Fred Hutch faculty, staff, and affiliates. Students must bring a laptop to each class. Please be sure your laptop can connect to the Marconi on-campus wireless network prior to the first class.
