title: Use the 5W framework to get your own personal study plan from ChatGPT (or other LLM)
---


<i>Note: this blog post is a summary of a talk I have delivered to test groups.</i>

One of the most rewarding (and challenging) aspects of software testing is keeping up to date with the pace of change in the industry- from new test tools, changes in the technology stack or wider disruption (AI is a great example).

Therefore the ability to self-learn and learn ‘on the job’ is a key skill for a software tester, and with that in mind I’ve found utilising the 5W framework invaluable to take advantage of what ChatGpt ) or any other large language model) can offer. 

### Why do we need a framework?

This is a simple technique which forces us to think through what information and material we want out of the LLM. This will give us a structure to both our prompts, and the response we get back. 

### What is the 5W?

This technique is from an excellent blog from Tina Huang, and is originally based on learning a programming language but is equally applicable to test related learning:

Apply 5 W framework to get a more relevant response (the example used here is to learn Selenium):
<strong>
<ul>

<li>Who? What role does ChatGPT have-  e.g. tutor/trainer.</li>
<li>What? Do we want to learn? (e.g. Selenium web driver with Java).</li>
<li>When? Timeline, amount of time available.</li>
<li>Where? Online courses, videos or text based courses.</li>
<li>Why? What's the goal? (e.g. Automated testing using Java/Selenium).</li>

</ul>

### 5W prompt example

Based on this example, this gives us the following prompt to input into the LLM:

<strong>Act as a coding tutor to create a study plan to help me learn Selenium  using Java to be able to create automated tests for front end e-commerce systems. I can study for up to 6 hours a week for 8 weeks, and prefer interactive, example based free resources.
Suggest reliable web resources that can be easily found through a web search or by directly visiting the official websites.</strong>


The above style of prompt should give a structured plan based in the 5W what, in the timelines defined in the when. I’ve found this approach helpful when learning Cypress for example.

### Do we need a framework?

Some of the advantages of using this framework in ChatGPT (or another LLM):

<ul>

<li>Gives a structed plan, with suggested resources.</li>
<li>Its adaptable- if our focus or timelines change, we can change the study plan.</li>
<li>Relevant- we can add or remove topics/elements of the plan where necessary (not possible in an ‘off the shelf’ course)</li>
</ul>

I’ve personally used this framework as part of our development and learning in BJSS Test & Assurance, and it’s the basis of a talk I’ve presented at [Test Talks Wales]( https://www.meetup.com/test-talks-wales/events/298323939/), and [Ministry of Testing Talks Newcastle](https://www.meetup.com/mot-newcastle/events/298859530/).
