[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) is a vector graphics editor (like Illustrator) which is free and runs on all desktop operating systems.
It is simple yet exceedingly powerful, and is a great choice for scientific illustration.
This free introductory course will get you started.

This course will be taught by Erick Matsen, who has been using Inkscape on a regular basis for over a decade.
