From Michael Gutteridge, via the [scicomp-announce mailing list](https://lists.fhcrc.org/mailman/listinfo/scicomp-announce):


Scientific Computing is offering two training courses in February:

## UNIX 101 (Course number UNIX02)
### *Wednesday Feb 11 9:00am - 12:00pm*

A basic introduction to using Unix and Linux.
Includes the how and why of many shell commands, process control, file operations, and other essentials for using the command line.

Materials are available [here](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Unix%20101/unix-101.html).


## Introduction to gizmo (Course number UNIX03)
### *Wednesday Feb 18 9:00am - 12:00pm*

A primer on using the Hutch HPC environment colloquially known as "gizmo".
We'll cover how to access and use the computing resources provided by Scientific Computing.
You should have a basic familiarity with shell operations (see Unix 101 above).

Materials are available [here](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Introduction%20to%20Gizmo/gizmo-101.html#slide1).
