This is just a test post for MathJax, which should render \$$ x_1 \wedge \dots \wedge x_k = \bigotimes V_j \$$ correctly. In addition, we try the following syntaxes to see if they work.

Let $\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}$ be categories, and \( F:\mathbf{C} \rightleftarrows \mathbf{D}: G \) be _pseudo-inverse functors_, i.e., functors such that there exists \[ \eta: 1_\mathbf{C} \tilde{\to} G\circ F \] where $\eta \in \text{Fun}(\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D})$.

Such a post should also contain some images!
