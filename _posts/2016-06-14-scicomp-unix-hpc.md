From Michael Gutteridge, via the [scicomp-announce mailing list](https://lists.fhcrc.org/mailman/listinfo/scicomp-announce):


Scientific Computing is hosting two courses related to use of the computing resources available at the Hutch:

## Unix 101 (Course number UNIX02)

### *Tuesday Jun 14 in J2-115, 9:00am - 12:00pm*

"Unix 101" is an introduction to Unix basics such as navigating and managing the Unix hierarchical file system, shell commands, shell scripts, and the shell environment.
Lessons are focused on the command line, not any of the graphical interfaces (e.g. Gnome, KDE, etc.) though basic X display management is discussed.

This course is designed for individuals new to Unix and Linux.


Materials are available [here](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Unix%20101/unix-101.html).


## Introduction to Gizmo (Course number UNIX03)

### *Tuesday Jun 21 in J2-115, 9:00am - 12:00pm*

"Introduction to Gizmo" will teach you how the Gizmo cluster works and how to effectively use the resources in this environment (resource selection, usage limits, etc.).

This course requires basic knowledge of using the Unix command-line environment, text-based editors (vi, emacs, et alia), and shell scripting (Unix 101 minimum).


Materials are available [here](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Introduction%20to%20Gizmo/gizmo-101.html#slide1).
