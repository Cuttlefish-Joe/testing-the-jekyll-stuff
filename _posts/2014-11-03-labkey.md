### *3:30 to 4:30 pm Monday, November 3rd M1-A305/307*

Translational research teams must make sense of diverse types of data while collaborating across boundaries of systems, organizations, and expertise.

The LabKey Server open source platform (<http://labkey.org>) helps such teams integrate, reproducibly analyze, and securely share not just clinical and specimen information, but also the complex results of high-throughput assays.

Over 100 installations of the LabKey Server platform serve translational research organizations all over the world, including the Statistica
l Center for HIV & AIDS Research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ([Atlas](http://atlas.scharp.org)) and the Immune Tolerance Network ([ITN TrialShare](http://itntrialshare.org)).

We will explore how these teams use LabKey Server to speed discovery, then demonstrate how LabKey Serverâ€™s pipeline and graphical interface can be used to analyze, visualize and selectively share RNASeq results.
