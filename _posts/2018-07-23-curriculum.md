We are excited to announce a new plan for computational training available through fredhutch.io to better meet the needs of 
our research community. We have a [redesigned mission]() that focuses on reproducible methods across tools and programming 
languages. Our restructured course curriculum is comprised of modularly-designed ca. 4 week courses, with each class meeting 
once a week 
for two hours and covering a specific topic in computational biology. This approach will allow us to offer high-demand 
courses, such as introductions to R and Python, on a regular basis, as well as continued development of intermediate courses 
to suit the interests of researchers across campus. 

Over the next few months, weâ€™ll begin gradually rolling out our modified curriculum. Our continually developing course listing 
is visible on the [Resources page](). We are still actively developing our coursework and strategy, so please let us know via 
[this form](https://goo.gl/forms/PHxEc620npZjnudi2) if there is anything you would like to see taught
