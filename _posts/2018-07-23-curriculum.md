We are excited to announce a new plan for computational training available through fredhutch.io to better meet the needs of 
our research community. We have a [redesigned mission](http://www.fredhutch.io/about/) that focuses on reproducible methods 
across tools and programming languages. Our restructured curriculum is comprised of modularly-designed ca. 4 week 
courses, with each class meeting once a week 
for two hours and covering a specific topic in computational biology. This approach will allow us to offer high-demand, 
introductory courses on a regular basis, as well as continued development of intermediate courses 
to suit the interests of researchers across campus. Our course listings 
are visible on the [Resources page](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/) under "Current curriculum," and will continue to be 
updated as new classes are developed.

We'll begin delivering these new, modified courses over the next few months. If you've been on a waitlist for courses like 
Introduction to R or Introduction to Python, you'll be automatically enrolled in that class according to the order in which 
you signed up. If you can't make it this month, just let us know and we'd be happy to add you to the following month's class. 
You can add yourself to the waitlist by heading over to 
[Hutch Learning](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/training/lms-project/hutch-learning-information.html), searching for 
classes available through fredhutch.io, and clicking the "Request" 
button. 

We are still actively developing our coursework and strategy, so please let us know via 
[this form](https://goo.gl/forms/PHxEc620npZjnudi2) about what computational training you'd like to see offered.
