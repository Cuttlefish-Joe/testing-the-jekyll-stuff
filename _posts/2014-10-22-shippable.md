### Avi Cavale, Shippable

### *3 to 4 pm Wednesday, October 22nd M1-A305*


[Shippable](http://www.shippable.com/) is a company based in Seattle offering continuous integration service.
Continuous integration (CI) is where an automated process runs every time new computer programming code is checked into a repository.
A unique feature of the Shippable platform is that they do CI in encapsulated, reproducibly-built and persistent [Docker](http://docker.io) containers, meaning that any language and configuration can be used.
This is especially useful for data analysis pipelines, which may incorporate a large collection of interacting components.

In this talk, Avi will introduce the basics of continuous integration and containers, and how those come together in Shippable.

### About Avi
Avi Cavale is co-founder and CEO of Shippable.
Prior to Shippable, Avi has worked in and managed large teams developing cutting edge technology in Microsoft for Kinect, Office 365, Lync, Xbox, and Azure.
