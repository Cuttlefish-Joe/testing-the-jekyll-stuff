This in-depth course will be an introduction to the [Julia programming language](http://julialang.org/).
Julia is a relatively new programming language designed for technical computing.
It is designed to be simple and expressive, but perform at speeds comparable to C.
It has a substantial package library and an elegant foreign function interface, with which one can easily call C, R, and Python.

This workshop will be by taught by Jeff Bezanson, co-creator of Julia, and will introduce the language, going from basics through data handling and parallelism.
The workshop includes four hours of instruction and a one-hour lunch break.

This course is open to Fred Hutch faculty, staff, and affiliates (i.e., anyone with a Fred Hutch ID).
Attendees must bring a laptop to the class.
