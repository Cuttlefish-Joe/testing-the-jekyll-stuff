Back when I was learning HTML, I had a hard time coming up with HTML practice project ideas. You may be going through the same challenge. I made this list so that you don&#8217;t waste time trying to find ideas.

The ideas in this list are open-ended. You can choose a unique angle for the ideas that I have presented. I have seperated the ideas into === categories.


## 1. Hobby projects

If you have any hobby, find some content to share about your hobby be it pictures or videos that you want to appear on your web page. If you are into building projects this hobby section should excite you.

## Picking an idea for your project

If you didn&#8217;t find any idea that you like, there are 2 ways that I can help you:


  1. Pick an idea that you thought was interesting and personalise it.<!-- wp:paragraph -->
    
  2. List your interests/ hobbies and google something interesting about them. Then make a page of what you finally come up with.


As you read through the projects list and get an idea, explore it.


## Content for your project

Once you have chosen an idea, you need to find/ create content in the form of text, videos and images. There are two ways to do this:


  1. You can write the content yourself. However, if writing the content gets in the way of practising HTML, go with the second method.
  2. You can get content under Creative Commons license. If you are truly not inspired, got to Wikipedia and get some of the content there. I suggested Wikipedia because most if not all content is open source. Give proper attribution when you use someone&#8217;s content.
