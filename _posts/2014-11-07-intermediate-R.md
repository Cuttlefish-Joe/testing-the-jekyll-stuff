### Jerry Davison, FHCRC Genomics & Bioinformatics Shared Resource

### **Day 1 class date:** *Friday Nov 7 in M1-A305/A307, 9:00am - 1:00pm*

### **Day 2 class date:** *Friday Nov 14 in M1-A305/A307, 9:00am - 1:00pm*


The FHCRC Genomics & Bioinformatics Shared Resource is presenting a
short course over two half-days at the FHCRC Day Campus teaching
aspects of computing with R. Registration is now open, attendance is
limited to FHCRC faculty, staff and students, and Cancer Consortium
and UW CFAR members.

The course material is at an intermediate level and intended for
scientists who are familiar with and comfortable using R; class
members will use their personal laptops to access high-performance
computers and work with example data.

Topics covered: day 1, using Linux operating system computers,
including for FHCRC attendees the computing resources provided by the
Hutch scientific computing group; common Linux commands, and using
multiple cores to speed execution. There are in-class exercises, we'll
discuss your solutions. An introduction to RNAseq analysis follows
immediately: aspects of experiment design, sequence alignment,
counting reads, filtering your data, and calculating differential
representation.  More in-class exercises and your solutions.  RNAseq
instruction and discussion continues on day 2.

**To register** for the course complete the form at the web
page below.  If you have questions about the course please contact
