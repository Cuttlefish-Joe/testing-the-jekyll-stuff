Have a question about bioinformatics and data science training available on campus? Looking for a resource to improve your coding skills? Interested in applying skills learned in classes to your own research problems? Kate will be hosting office hours on Tuesdays from 9 am to noon and is happy to talk about these questions and more! For the next month or so, these sessions will be held in M1-B153 (Arnold), but check CenterNet for location and scheduling changes due to holidays. 

In early 2019, office hours will be moving to the new training, co-working, and small group meeting space in M1-B406 (Arnold), called Coop Studio. To keep up with these and additional notifications, please consider joining [The Coop's new listserv](https://lists.fhcrc.org/mailman/listinfo/thecoop).
