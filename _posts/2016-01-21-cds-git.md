Paul Litwin from Collaborative Data Services is going to be giving a talk coming up on Git, the version control system.
Here is his description:

Programmers, statisticians, and data scientists all have
the need for version control and the sharing of source
code and other materials. Come to this session to learn
about git, a free distributed version control system that
runs on Windows, Linux, and OS/X. You will learn how to
create a git repository (repo), and how to stage and commit
changes. You will also learn how to create a remote repo
on GitHub and how to pull and push changes to GitHub.
You will learn about creating branches and merging
changes. Paul's demos will primarily use git at the
Windows command line and OS/X terminal, but Paul will
also discuss other ways to use git.
