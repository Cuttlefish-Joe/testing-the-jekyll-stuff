### Grade Inflation
Today we're going to talk about the causes of grade inflation. 
"Wait, is this going to be on the test?" 

You're a professor and you grade the paper a C.  The next day Type A
Personality Only Child comes up on you, "how is this a C?  I answered
the question correctly, didn't I?" Yes, but you write like a nine year
old, 80% of this is the syntactical equivalent of "umm" and
"ahhh", and many of your sentences are minimally altered passages
right from Wikipedia.  "But this is a history class.  Why are
you grading my writing style?"

There's really no good way for a professor to respond to this nut.  The
depth of his stupidity precludes any explanation from being meaningful; he will
not be able to understand that the writing is a reflection of the rigor of the
ideas which is a reflection of the knowledge of the material and etc.  So
you give him an A and head to a strip bar.  I sympathize.

Two explanations are commonly offered for grade inflation-- and let me clarify
that the grade inflation people complain about is the kind that happens in the
introductory survey courses.  No one worries about grade inflation in the
400 level thermodynamics class.  1. Universities don't incentivize
teaching, they incentivize research, so the teaching suffers. 2. Students are
drunken idiots.   While both have merit, let's see if there isn't another
explanation that shrewdly protects the unconscious of most of the players.

#### I.



The only surprising thing to me about this graph is
nothing.  Since no one over 90 is reading this, let's focus on 1986. 
What happened in 1986 that changed the grading trend?


Generation X went to college, that's what.  Coincidentally, psychological
researchers Twenge et al
found that that was the year narcissism on campus began to rise:


And
by "coincidentally" I mean "not coincidentally."  It's
hard to tell a growing population of narcissists that their schoolwork blows,
so you don't: A.  Makes sense.

Most people stop their analysis right there, but you should really go the extra
three steps and not just pee in the sink: now those students are 40.  They
grew up to be the Dumbest
Generation of Narcissists In The History of the World, so
narcissistic that not only are they dumb, but they do not know how dumb they
are and cannot be told how dumb they are.  They are aware that there are
things they don't know, but they are certain that they have at least heard
of everything that's worth knowing.  Whenever the upper management guys at
Chronicle Of Higher Education or The National Review pretend to
disagree about the "classics" or "Great Books" or the
"value of a liberal education," after five minutes it becomes clear
that even they haven't read all those books, or most of them, or even a respectable
minority, or three.  They've read about them, ok, that's what
America does, but when you finally pin them down and they admit they haven't
read it-- which would be fine-- their final response is of the form
"there's no point in reading Confessions now since we've all moved
beyond that."  Oh.   And those are supposed to be the smart
ones; everyone else in the generation thinks that the speed at which they can
repeat the words they heard on TV or read on some magazine's website is evidence
of their understanding.


#### II.

Which brings me to the main point, the other cause of grade inflation that no
one ever talks about: in order for a grade to be inflated, a professor has to
inflate it.  In other words, grade inflation isn't the student's fault, it
is the professor's fault.  A kid can complain and whine/wine all he wants,
but unless that professor buckles, there's no grade inflation.  So the
starting point has to be: why does a professor inflate a grade?

Yikes.  Now that shudder you're feeling is not only why you never thought
it, but how it is possible no one else ever brought it up?  The answer is:
every discussion about grade inflation has been dominated by educators. 

The "college is a scam" train is one on which I'm all aboard, but
that doesn't mean each individual professor has to be scamming students;
there's no reason why he can't do a good job and teach his students something
that they aren't going to get simply by reading the text.  If a student
can skip class and still ace the class, the kid is either very bright or the
professor is utterly useless.  Right?   Either way, the kid's wasting
his money.

And I know every generation thinks the one coming up after it is weaker and
stupider, that's normal. But  why would a professor who thinks college kids
are dumb turn around and reward the King Of Beers with an A?

The answer is right in the chart and in a book by Allan Bloom that most college
professors have read about.  When that professor who was 40 in1986 was
back in college in 1966, he was part of a culture that believed there are no
"wrong answers, only wrong questions", like "you really think we
should we stop shaving?" or "should we listen to something other than
CCR?"  And meanwhile the rate of As doubled.  So now you have to
put up your money: if you believe that grade inflation at that time
masks/causes a real shallowness of intellect and education, then those
students, now professors, simply aren't as smart as they think they are. 
Unless you also believe that bad 60s music and even worse pot somehow augmented
their intellect.

And if you accept my thesis that narcissism prevents insight because it is
urgently and vigorously self-protecting, then these same professors are not aware
of their deficits.  They think they know the material they are teaching
simply because they are teaching it.

The problem is they are grading your papers and they do not know how to value a
paper.  Of course they can tell an A+ essay and they can tell an F- essay,
but they are pretty foggy on everything in between. But they do not realize
they are foggy.  They think the problem is "the students
complain."  So they judge essays in comparison to others in the class
or they fall back on the usual heuristics: page length, sentence complexity,
and  "looks like you put a lot of work into it."

And worse-- much worse, given that they are supposed to be educators-- they
have no idea how to take a so-so student and make him better; what,
specifically, they should get him to do, because they themselves were similarly
mediocre students who got inflated As.  Do you think they got their A in
freshman analytic philosophy and said to themselves, "Jesus, I know I
really didn't deserve this A, I better go back and try and relearn all this
stuff."  No: they went ahead and got jobs in academia, so that when a
student comes to them asking, "how can I do better?" they can
respond,  "You need to apply yourself."  Idiot.  The
system is broken.  You broke it.
#### III.

Here's an example. Say your essay question is, "describe the causes of the
American Civil War."  Ok, so far everything the kid knows he learned
from Prentice Hall, but something inside him thinks the answer is: LABOR
COSTS.  Hmmm.  Insightful and unexpected, let's see what he does with
it.

But there's not much he can do with it, there aren't many obvious resources to
pursue this "feeling" he has.  He does what he can.  It's
not that good.  C.  Grade inflation gives him a B.

Meanwhile, Balboa the el ed major searches carefully in his textbook and
discovers the cause was... SLAVERY.  He airlifts two sentences each out of
five other books, asks for an extension because his grandmother died, adds nine
hundred filler words including "for all intensive purposes" and
"he could care less", and then waits in the parking lot to threaten
you with "but this is a history class.  Why are you grading my
writing style?"  He gets an A.

The problem is that the first kid is strongly disincentivized from pursuing his
idea, from becoming a better thinker, in very specific ways.  

First, and obviously, since the majority of the students are going to
get an A, he just has to do just as well/horrifically as the average student,
and if they're all writing about slavery with the enthusiasm of a photocopier
then if he wants an A he better buckle down and learn the truly useful skill of
masking the words of a Wikipedia page.  

Second, he is very nervous about offering a professor anything that he didn't
hear the professor explicitly mention, let alone endorse. What if it's
"wrong?"
  
Third, because grading an essay is subjective, all professors try to make it
objective by attributing value to measurable quantities which are actually
stupid.  For example: in most undergrad classes, the bibliography counts
for 5%, maybe even 10%.  How you (that's right, I said "how
you") going to pad a bibliography with six sources when you can't even
find one to support your thesis?  So the pursuit of an interesting thesis
is blocked by the 5% of the grade that comes from something that should count
for exactly -20% of your grade, i.e. if you have a bibliography, you're a
jerk.(1)  This false value has two consequences: it "pads" the
grade (e.g. the student already starts with an easy +5-30%) so it is easier for
him to get an A.  But more importantly, it is now easy for the professor to
justify giving him an A.  "His content wasn't that great, but the
points added up; and besides: what the hell would I tell him to improve?"

I can't emphasize that last part enough-- the cause of the ridiculous grading
is not the complaining of students but the convenience of the professor.

This is why if you are in a class and you feel the need to ask, "how many
pages does this have to be?" and rather than look at you like you just
just sneezed herpes on his face he instead has a ready answer, you are wasting
your money.  I get that you need the degree, I understand the system,
but you're wasting your money nevertheless.


#### IV.

Take a quick scan of what these academics consider the highest level of
academic scholarship: read their own journals.  Here are the first three
paragraphs of the first article ("Terrorism and The American
Experience: A State Of The Field") in the temporally
coincident  month's Journal of American History, and I expect you
to read none of them:

>In 1970, just months before his death,
the historian Richard Hofstadter called on U.S. historians to engage the
subject of violence. For a generation, he wrote, the profession had ignored the
issue, assuming that consensus rather than conflict had shaped the American
past. By the late 1960s, with assassinations, riots, and violent crime at the
forefront of national anxieties, that assumption was no longer tenable.
Everywhere, Americans seemed to be thinking and talking about violence, except
within the historical profession. Hofstadter urged historians to remedy their
"inattention" and construct a history of violence that would speak to
both the present and the past.1

>Over the last four decades, the
historical profession has responded to that challenge. Studies of racial
conflict, territorial massacres, gendered violence, empire, crime and
punishment, and war and memory make up some of the most esteemed books of the
past generation. Yet on the subject of "terrorism," the form of violence
that currently dominates American political discourse, historians have had
comparatively little to say. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, a handful
of conferences have addressed historical aspects of terrorism, from its
nineteenth-century origins to its impact on state building and national
identity. Scholarly journals (including the Journal of American History) have
devoted the occasional special issue to examining terrorism's roots and
present-day implications. Within the historical profession, several book-length
works have taken up episodes of terrorism, examining the production of both
violence and state repression. Social scientists and journalists have offered
sweeping global histories, tracing the problem of terrorism from antiquity to the
present.2

>As a result, we have a better
understanding of terrorism's history than we did a decade ago, but it would be
hard to classify this surge of work as a flourishing subfield or even a
coherent historiography. Almost a decade out from 9/11, most U.S. historians
remain hard-pressed to explain what terrorism is, how and when it began, or
what its impact has been. There is little consensus about how best to approach
the subject or even whether to address it at all. This is partly because the
issue poses knotty political questions: How do we talk about terrorism without
reinforcing the "war on terror" or lapsing into hopeless presentism?
It also brings serious methodological problems: Is terrorism a word to be
traced through centuries of semantic permutation? Is it an epithet to be
applied to forms of violence we do not like? Is it a concept to be defined,
however loosely, and followed through time?

>Like any project that takes its cue
from current affairs, constructing a historiography of terrorism requires
caution and a light touch...


If a student wrote this I'd punch him in the bladder and get a good defense
lawyer, assault charges be damned.  I've deliberately avoided the easy
targets like the po-mo journals; this is "the leading scholarly publication
and the journal of record in the field of American history" and the
author  goes on like this for 20 pages.   Can you trust this
professor to grade an undergrad paper?  The first two paragraphs are
filler, meaningless noise in the guise of a sophisticated introduction. Maybe
she can tell an A+ and she can tell an F-, I have no idea, but is she in any
position to know a C from a B?  And help you improve?  Do you want to
write like her?  If you had questions about the history of terrorism, or
terrorism, or history, would you call her?

I picked her because she was at random, but the same forces apply ubiquitously:
academic journals are long, boring, poorly written academic-ese that no one
reads because whatever insights or information they possess are buried in...the
syntactical equivalent of "umms" and "ahhs."  Even
those who theoretically need journals to do their jobs every day (e.g. lawyers
and doctors) avoid them.

Apart from boycotting any classes taught by these people I don't know what the
solution is.  Some professors cleverly include a "class
participation" grade, and these professors pride themselves on using
"the Socratic method."  Sigh.  Asking random students
random questions is not the Socratic method, it's annoying,  In order for
it to be a true Socratic method, the professor would have to ask the student to
state a thesis, get him to agree to a number of assumptions, and then
masterfully show, through dialogue, how that agreement undermined his own
thesis.  In other words, the professor would have to have considerable
fluency with his topic and be interested in each individual student, as an
individual.  Good luck with that. (2)


#### V.

If you reconsider grade inflation not as a function of the quality of the
output but rather as the result of a hesitating lack of confidence about what
constitutes good quality-- and again, I'm talking not about A+ and F- but the
differences between the B and C levels where most "good" students
are; and accept that, simply as a numerical reality, these "average"
students are then the ones who (likely with the assistance of grade inflation)
go on to become future academics, then a number of phenomena suddenly make a
lot of sense. And the most important one is the one that students have long
suspected but never dared say out loud: professors do not know the material
they are teaching, but they think they do.
 
An American History professor may be considered somewhat of an expert because
he's been teaching the Civil War for the past 15 years, but he's only been
repeating what he knew 15 years ago for 15 years.  And every year he
forgets a little.   How carefully is he keeping up with it-- especially if
his "research interests" happen to lie elsewhere?  

I know doctors who have been giving the same receptor pharmacology lectures to
students for a decade.  I know they are narcissists, not just because they
are too apathetic to keep up with the field, but because it never occurred to
them that receptor pharmacology might have advanced in ten years.  They
believe that what they knew ten years ago is enough.  They are bigger than
the science.  These aren't just some lazy doctors in community practice,
these are Ivy League physicians responsible for educating new doctors
with new information.  Yet the Power Point slides say 2001. 
"Well, I'm just teaching them the basics."  How do you know
those are still the basics?  Who did you ask?

You think you philosophy professor re-reads Kant every year? The last time he
did was in graduate school-- when his brain was made of graduate student and
beer.  Think about this.  Hecko, has he even lately read about
Kant?  Do you think he tries, just to stay sharp, to take a current event
and see what Kant might say about it? No, same notes on a yellow legal pad from
Reagan II.  Does he "know" Kant because he's been "teaching
Kant" for 20 years?  When in his life is he "challenged" by
someone else who "knows" Kant?  Seriously, think about
this.  For two decades the hardest questions he's been asked come from
students, and he's been able to handle them like a Jedi.  How could he not
think of himself as an expert?

The sclerosis of imagination and intellect that inevitably happens over
time will make it impossible for him to grade a paper that does not conform to
his expectations.  I don't mean it agrees with the professor, I mean his
expectations of what a good paper looks like.  Students already have a
phrase for this: "What he likes to see in the paper is..."

So when it comes time to write a paper about Kant, it is infinitely less
important that he understand Kant then it is for him to understand what the
professor thinks is important about Kant-- and it is way easier to get through
college this way.  And if you have the misfortune of being taught Kant by
a guy whose "research interests" are not Kant, forget it. 
You're getting an A, and he hates you.

#### VI.

This stuff matters, it has real consequences.  When one narcissistic
generation sets up the pieces for the next generation, and you put the rooks in
the middle and leave out the bishops and hide one of the knights, and then you
tell the kids that they lack the intelligence or concentration to really learn
chess, you have to figure they're not going to want to pay for your Social
Security.  Just a thought.

Also: TAs are helping grade some of the papers, and some is worse than
all.  In order to ensure grading consistency, the essay answer has to be
structured in a format that facilitates grading-- because if the professor
can't value a B form a C, how can a TA?  So the answer must mirror the six
points in the textbook or the four things mentioned in class.  This,
again, means you shouldn't spend any time learning, you should spend it gaming
the essay.    So if the essay question is, "Discuss some of the
causes of the Iraq War" you can be dead sure that "some" means
specifically the ones the professor thinks are important.  There may be
others, but you're taking a big risk mentioning them. The TAs are just scanning
for keywords.  As long as they're in there, even in grammatically impossible
constructions, you win.  A. (3)

#### VII.

Here's one solution: abandon grades.

"But we have to have some way of objectively evaluating students!"

Haven't you been listening?  You can't just suck the Red Pill like a Jolly
Rancher, you have to swallow it.  Grades aren't objectively measuring
people, the whole thing is a farce.  The grades are meaningless.  Not
only do they not measure anything, but the manner in which they are inflated
precludes real learning.  Stop it.

"Some grades aren't inflated."  But how would anyone on the
outside know? Can you tell them apart?  The long term result will be: bad
money drives out good money.

"Well, I earned my As."  No you didn't, that's the point. 
I'm not saying you're not smart or didn't work hard, I'm saying you have no
idea how good or bad you are,  you only think you do.

"Just pass/fail?  But how will employers know a good student from a
bad student?"  Again, you are avoiding the terrible, awful truth
because it is too terrible and too awful: when  employers look at a GPA, they
don't know anything.  The 3.5 they are looking at is information bias,
it not only contains no information, it deludes you into thinking you
possess information. You can't erase that 3.7 from your mind.   In what
classes, in what levels, against what curve?  Just because employers do it
doesn't mean it's useful.  They use sexual harassment videos, too.

Grades do not only offer incorrect evaluations of a student's knowledge, they
perpetuate the fiction that professors are able to evaluate.  They
can't.  Again, they may be able to tell an A+ and an F-, but a B+ from a
B?  Really?  That's the level of their precision? But a professor
cannot ever admit that he doesn't have that precision, because it cannot enter
his consciousness that he doesn't.  "I've been teaching this class
for 15 years."   And I'm sure it gets easier every year.

#### VIII.

Speaking of Iraq: on the eve of the Iraq War many Americans got together to
demonstrate.  I'm not in the protest demographic, the only way I'm going
to be at a march is if there's alcohol, but I accept the fact that a protest is
sometimes the only way to be heard and the last resort against a government
that has forsaken you.  I get it.  Ok.  So I'm watching the
protests on TV, and a lot of people quite obviously don't want to go to war,
and want it stopped at all costs.  And I see a group of people with signs
walking behind a long banner, and the signs and the banner say, basically,
"UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS AGAINST THE WAR."

I've no doubt that there wasn't a little bit of the old Vietnam nostalgia
there, but what made me furious was the signs.  They actually believed
that identifying themselves as university professors was helping the
cause?  Did they think Americans were going to slap their foreheads,
"wow, educated people are against the war, maybe I gots to rethinks
this?"  Yes, that is exactly what they thought.

They could not see that they were sabotaging their own cause, that anyone
ambivalent about Iraq would either not think anything or be blinded by white
rage, "look at these mother--" and vote for Bush six more
times.  These professors were coming from such a profoundly 
narcissistic stance that they didn't see this, or they didn't care. 
They may have wanted to stop the war, but what was much, much, much, much, much
more important was to be identified as against the war, even if by doing
that they were causing other people to support the war.

Here's what TV didn't show: the next day, those professors went to their
classes, taught a bunch of anxious, restless but bored students stuff that they
really had no business teaching, and later asked them to write essays that
could be graded essentially as multiple choice questions so that they wouldn't
really have to read them.  If these professors didn't realize or care that
that they were violating their own principles about war merely to
self-identify, do you think they care about you?  They have much bigger
things to worry about.  A.


1.  Bibliography, as distinct from references.  Anyone who produces a
Bibliography without specific references as some sort of support of the truth
of their idiocy is on notice.  I'm talking to you, DSM.

2. An interesting educational experiment would be to come at things form a
negative perspective.  "Look, class, Hegel was a complete jerk, and
his ideas were infantile pseudo-buddhism garbage.  I'll give 50 points and
a candy bar to anyone who can explain to me why."  And see if that
doesn't inspire the student to want to understand what Hegel was trying to
say.  I don't know if this will work.  I know that a disengaged
professor saying that Hegel is a great German philosopher and then reading
lecture notes written back in 1986 on a yellow legal pad very clearly doesn't
work.

3. Here's an essay I'd love to read, hell, love to write:  *There are
numerous "established" causes of the Iraq War, yet they almost always
cite reasons that occurred after 1990.  Please watch the 1975 film *Three
Days of The Condor.*  Other than a Tardis, what explanations could
there be for director Sydney Pollack's ability to predict the future with such
accuracy?  Please discuss some of the events of the late 1960s to early
1970s that made the finale's prediction possible.*
