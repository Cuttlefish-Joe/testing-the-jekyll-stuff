## Lasagne

XXX
You know you're not in the best place when, upon opening the oven door to a cake that you've been making, you find that it sank in the middle and end up sitting on the floor sobbing that you're a failure and you can't even bake any more.

However, last weekend, I managed to overturn my cooking slump when I decided to make lasagne scratch. A lasagne that turned out far better than I could've hoped for. Not just any recipe, either: a Mary Berry one. *nods sagely* 

I found the recipe on Pinterest, which came from a seperate blog post [here](http://cherryonacake.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/meat-lasagna.html). It differs ever so slightly from the original MB one, and I changed mine slightly, as well, winging it somewhat to create this:

My name is Jess and here are a few facts about me that are true.: I am a **writer**. I do [parkour](). I hate mayonnaise and my hair colour changes often.

And gradually, I am beginning to think "I can do this."
