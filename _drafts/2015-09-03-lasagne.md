## A New Post

You know you're not in the best place when, upon opening the oven door to a cake that you've been making, you find that it sank in the middle and end up sitting on the floor sobbing that you're a failure and you can't even bake any more - something I used to do on a regular basis and was actually pretty good at, if I do say so myself.

However, last weekend, I managed to overturn my cooking slump when I decided to make lasagne scratch. A lasagne that turned out far better than I could've hoped for. Not just any recipe, either: a Mary Berry one. *nods sagely* 

I found the recipe on Pinterest, which came from a seperate blog post [here](http://cherryonacake.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/meat-lasagna.html). It differs ever so slightly from the original MB one, and I changed mine slightly, as well, winging it somewhat to create this:

And gradually, I am beginning to think "I can do this."
