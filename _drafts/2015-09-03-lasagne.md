## Lasagne

Hello, there. 

A place for me to air my thoughts; to take them out of my head, examine them and then, hopefully having made sense of it all, put it out there for you, dear reader, to do what you will with them. 

You know you're not in the best place when, upon opening the oven door to a cake that you've been making, you find that it sank in the middle and end up sitting on the floor sobbing that you're a failure and you can't even bake any more.

After much consoling from the Boy and my mom, I got up, shook myself off and promised myself I'd try again and soon. This happened when last weekend, I managed to overturn my cooking slump and decided to make lasagne from scratch. A lasagne that turned out far better than I could've hoped for. Not just any recipe, either: a Mary Berry one...*nods sagely*. 

I found the recipe on this blog [here](http://cherryonacake.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/meat-lasagna.html). It differs ever so slightly from the original MB one, and I changed mine slightly, as well, winging it somewhat to create this:

My name is Jess and here are a few facts about me that are consistently true: 

- I am a **writer**
- I do **parkour** 
- I hate **mayonnaise**
- My **hair colour** changes often
- And as stated above, I love **cooking/baking**

One of my most admired writers is screenwriter/director, [Norah Ephron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001188/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). She's an all round inspiring woman, but her films, [Julie & Julia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/?ref_=nm_knf_i3) and [You've Got Mail](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128853/?ref_=nm_knf_i1) are two of my all-time favourites - they're witty, clever and easy, happy watching. They just make my day. 

Julie, if you ever see this, know that as Julia was to you, you have been an inspiration to me. I was feeling lost and I realise that I also have been like that for a long time, creatively - reading about how you stuck to your project gives me hope that I can do the same. 

If you would like to, dear reader, please do take a look at my [Tumblr](http://blog.wildfire198.com) for old blog posts - I warn you, it hasn't been updated in a long time and kind of dissolved into a series of re-blogging cool things. There are some interesting things to be found in archives, I'm sure.

And gradually, I am beginning to think 'I can do this.'
