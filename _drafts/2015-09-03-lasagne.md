## Lasagne

![Lasagne a la me]({{site.baseurl}}/_drafts/IMG_2569.jpg)

Hello, there. 

Welcome to my blog. 

A place for me to air my thoughts; to take them out of my head, examine them and then, hopefully having made sense of it all, put it out there for you, dear reader, to do  with them what you will. 

Life's been quite strange for me this year. After a long battle with cancer, my Grandmother passed away in May and I've been struggling with things somewhat ever since then. Apparently, this is normal in grieving. It doesn't make it any easier, though. 

You know you're not in the best place when, upon opening the oven door to a cake that you've been making, you find that it sank in the middle and end up sitting on the floor sobbing that you're a failure and you can't even bake any more.

After much consoling from the Boy and my mom, I got up, shook myself off and promised myself I'd try again and soon. This happened when last weekend, I managed to overturn my cooking slump and decided to make lasagne from scratch. A lasagne that turned out far better than I could've hoped for. Not just any recipe, either: a Mary Berry one...*nods sagely*. 

I found the recipe on this blog [here](http://cherryonacake.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/meat-lasagna.html). It differs ever so slightly from the original MB one, and I changed mine slightly, as well, winging it somewhat to create this:

My name is Jess and here are a few facts about me that are consistently true: 

- I am a **writer**
- I do **parkour** 
- I hate **mayonnaise**
- My **hair colour** changes often
- And as stated above, I love **cooking/baking**

One of my most admired writers is screenwriter/director, [Norah Ephron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001188/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). She's an all round inspiring woman, but her films, [Julie & Julia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/?ref_=nm_knf_i3) and [You've Got Mail](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128853/?ref_=nm_knf_i1) are two of my all-time favourites - they're witty, clever and easy, happy watching. They just make my day. 

It struck me the other night whilst watching Julie & Julia that I was feeling very much like the main character, Julie Powell, was in the film in that life wasn't quite working for her. She didn't finish anything. Her friends all seemed far more successful and like they were getting on with their lives, whilst she was left behind; and had long since abandoned her ideas of being a writer in favour of working for the government; something that she did not relish. 

Julie, if you ever see this, know that as Julia was to you, you have been an inspiration to me.  

If you would like to, dear reader, please do take a look at my [Tumblr](http://blog.wildfire198.com) for old blog posts - I warn you, it hasn't been updated in a long time and kind of dissolved into a series of re-blogging cool things. There are some interesting things to be found in archives, I'm sure. 

My main goal for this blog is to get myself back into writing. This was actually the only requisite my lovely boyfriend made when setting it up for me and that I would do so on a regular basis. It will be a forum for me to vent, give my opinions and maybe have a little bit of a rant. I will also discuss different topics that I'm into. For example: 

- Writing
- Design
- Techy stuff
- Films
- etc, etc

Hopefully, it will give you the opportunity to find out how my brain works and to see what my writing style is like.

And gradually, I am beginning to think 'I can do this.'
