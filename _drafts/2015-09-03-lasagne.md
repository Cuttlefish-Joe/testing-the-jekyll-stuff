## Lasagne

XXX
You know you're not in the best place when, upon opening the oven door to a cake that you've been making, you find that it sank in the middle and end up sitting on the floor sobbing that you're a failure and you can't even bake any more.

After much consoling from the Boy and my mom, I got up, shook myself off and promised myself I'd try again and soon. This happened when last weekend, I managed to overturn my cooking slump and decided to make lasagne from scratch. A lasagne that turned out far better than I could've hoped for. Not just any recipe, either: a Mary Berry one...*nods sagely*. 

I found the recipe on Pinterest, which came from a seperate blog post [here](http://cherryonacake.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/meat-lasagna.html). It differs ever so slightly from the original MB one, and I changed mine slightly, as well, winging it somewhat to create this:

My name is Jess and here are a few facts about me that are true: 

- I am a **writer**
- I do parkour 
- I hate mayonnaise
- My hair colour changes often

I'm a big fan of [Norah Ephron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001188/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) - she's an amazing writer/director, and an all round inspiring woman. Julie and Julia is one of my favourite films and 

Julie, if you ever see this, know that as Julia was to you, you have been an inspiration to me. I was feeling lost and I realise that I have been like that for a long time, creatively - reading about how you stuck to your project gives me hope that I can do the same. 

If you, dear reader, would like to, please do take a look at my [Tumblr](http://blog.wildfire198.com) for old blog posts - I warn you, it hasn't been updated in a long time and kind of dissolved into a series of re-blogging cool things. There are some interesting things to be found in archives, I'm sure.

And gradually, I am beginning to think 'I can do this.'
