Let's go forward working with the mindset that there is no box. You can be whomever you want to be and do whatever you want to do. If you love both knitting and sky-diving, then do both; if you want to be a CEO and a circus clown because you enjoy it, that's fine. 

These are obviously very random and extreme examples, but it's no different to being multi-disciplined in your career. Many people have employable skills that they don't even realise they've got because they're not "required" under their job description.
