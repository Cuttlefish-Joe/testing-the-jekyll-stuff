## Creativity

XX

Sometimes it can feel like if you don't fit into a certain mould/box with a particular skill set and full focus on one area e.g. graphic design or web development, you're not worth considering. There is no room for multi-tasking at that creative table. However, everyone must have more than one thing that they're good at. If that bleeds into their career, then what's the harm in that? Surely if you can provide a company with a wide variety of skills, then you're more valuable than not?

Let's go forward working with the mindset that there is no box. You can be whomever you want to be and do whatever you want to do. If you love both knitting and sky-diving, then do both; if you want to be a CEO and a circus clown because you enjoy it, that's fine. 

These are obviously very random and extreme examples, but it's no different to being multi-disciplined in your career. Many people have employable skills that they don't even realise they've got because they're not "required" under their job description.

I want to be creative in every aspect of my life: be it my work; doing [Parkour](https://youtu.be/2Iapa03dfLU) - my favourite form of exercise and physical creative expression; or even something as simple as writing a list (more on this in another post). If it's not colourful or thoughtfully considered as to how it can inspire and look good, then why bother?
