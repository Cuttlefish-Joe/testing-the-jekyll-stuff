After years of experience as a Test Lead working on test strategy, planning, test management etc. I started working in cloud first, CI/CD projects and really enjoyed the more technical aspect to these projects.

To further my knowledge and skills I joined a tech consultancy to gain hands on experience of test enginering, including automation, test tools, CI/CD, Non Functional testing and more. 

Working in succesuful, productive agile teams in CI/DO projects has given me a great insight into how automated testing fits into an effective project delivery, the role quality and testing plays in this and a technical understanding of the tools and technology involved.

## Testio Test blog

One of the rewarding aspects of a career on software testing is the collaborative and supportive nature of the industry, for example see the community at Ministry Of Testing, Test Talks and many other industry related meet ups. In sharing my experience and guides in ths blog I hope to contribute to this.
This blog will cover some of the material I have found useful and practical, in the hope that other people will find it helpful.
