Hello, there - it’s nice to meet you. My name is Jess and I’m a designer/illustrator and writer from Bristol. I can usually be found either doodling or scribbling down a story or two, sipping coffee in a local coffee house when I’m not working at the day job.
 
In the past, my writing skills have been put to use as a Staff Writer for Lost in the Multiplex (sadly, no longer on the web), writing film reviews, articles and interviewing some cool people from the film industry.
 
I’m a bit of a self-confessed ‘Japanophile’ and am regularly influenced by things such as Japanese cinema and anime, the culture, and heritage in my work - hopefully, one day I might even get to travel there!
 
I like to keep my skills sharp and am constantly looking for new things to learn - at the moment, I’m currently improving my skills in HTML and CSS, building my first website from scratch, and embarking on learning Ruby on Rails. 
 
Having once been likened to the guys on the Big Bang Theory, my interests are quite geeky and include things such as sci-fi movies/TV, gaming, comic books, collecting vinyl toys and much more.
 
Not one to sit on my laurels, when I’m not being distracted by pretty shiny things, I can be found ‘jumping about’ doing parkour around Bristol, spending time with friends, taking photos or getting busy in the kitchen.
