title: About Me
---

After years of experience as a Test Lead working on test strategy, planning, test management etc. I started working in cloud first, CI/CD projects and really enjoyed the more technical aspect to these projects.

To further my knowledge and skills I joined a tech consultancy to gain hands on experience of test enginering, including automation, test tools, CI/CD, Non Functional testing and more. 

Working in succesuful, productive agile teams in CI/CD projects has given me a great insight into how automated testing fits into an effective project delivery, the role quality and testing plays in this and a technical understanding of the tools and technology involved.

## About Testio Test blog

One of the rewarding aspects of a career on software testing is the wealth of collaboratiion an innovation in the  testing comunnity, including many great blogs/websites (too many to mention here) and brilliant groups such as Ministry of Testing and Test Talks. I've benefited a great deal from the blogs, meet ups, industry talks and I'd like to use this blog to make my own small contribution, so I hope you find it useful/of some interest.

Finally, as I'm based in Wales the word 'Testio' is a slang/informal word for testing in Welsh (emphasis on informal!) so I have a bi-lingual blog title :)
