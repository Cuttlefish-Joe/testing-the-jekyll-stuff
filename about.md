I created the website to help you on your coding journey. You will be able to create websites immediately after learning HTML.

It focused on beginners, and anyone who only want to create something useful but is not ready to learn lots of languages while starting out.

I also created this website so that I can document my journey in Web development. When I started to explore the tech world, I did not find a lot of content to help me. I am confident that you will find insightful and useful as you explore the tech world.

It is my hope that I can explain things with the beginners mindset that will help you if you are just one step behind me.
