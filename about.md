About Me

After years of experience as a Test Lead working on test strategy, planning, test management etc. I was fascinated with cloud first, CI/CD projects and wanted to gain more experience in this field.

I moved out of my comfort zone and  joined a tech consultancy to gain hands on experience of test automation, test tools, CI/CD, NFR testing and more.
