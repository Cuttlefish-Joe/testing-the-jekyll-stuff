fhcrc.io is an initiative to facilitate education about and promote access to computational resources at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It is funded through and reviewed by Shared Resources, and was started by [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/) and [Brian Claywell](https://github.com/bcclaywell).

Our current primary focus is on building out a full-featured Galaxy instance that will be useful for Center researchers with no programming experience to analyze their data.
