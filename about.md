fredhutch.io promotes bioinformatics education and access to computational methods at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center by:

* Teaching short courses on introductory and intermediate computer programming to facilitate open, reproducible research methods
* Facilitating use of computational resources available to researchers at Fred Hutch
* Coordinating with other local groups developing and delivering training on computational research methods
* Developing cooperative communities of practice to pursue learning in advanced, special topics in computational analysis

The initiative was started by [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org/) and [Brian Claywell](https://github.com/bcclaywell) and funded through and reviewed by the Public Health Sciences division.
