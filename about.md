fredhutch.io is an initiative to facilitate education about and promote access to computational resources at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It was started by [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org/) and [Brian Claywell](https://github.com/bcclaywell) and funded through and reviewed by the Public Heath Sciences division.

Our current primary focus is on building out a full-featured Galaxy instance that will be useful for Center researchers with no programming experience to analyze their data.
