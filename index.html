<div class="aboutMe">
	<p>
		I'm at the final stage of my HK RGC-funded PhD Fellowship at <a href="#">City University of Hong Kong</a>. My PhD project investigates the politics of web-maps through controversies, with a focus on Jerusalem. More broadly, my research interests include the politics of digital technologies, postcolonial geographies, and political participation.

		Before starting my PhD, I worked as a mapping assistant to <a href="#">Grassroots Jerusalem</a>, a Palestinian NGO that, in addition and support to their advocacy work, collaborates with local communities to map Jerusalem from a Palestinian perspective.
			I hold a Masters in Urban Studies from University College of London, and a Bachelor in Architecture from the Berlin Technische Universit√§t.
