### R and RStudio

R and RStudio are separate downloads.
R is the "engine", while RStudio is an integrated desktop environment (IDE) that makes using R much more pleasant.
R must be installed before RStudio.
Follow the instructions below for your operating system to install them.


#### Windows

* Download the installer for the latest version of R from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
  The file will begin downloading automatically.
* Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the prompts to install.
* Go the the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

* Once both are installed, launch RStudio and make sure there are no error messages.


#### macOS

* Download the installer for the latest version of R compatible with your version of macOS from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
