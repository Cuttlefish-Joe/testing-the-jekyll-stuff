The fume board is black on one side and has an absorbent material glued on the other side.  A chemical with a smell that the honey bees do not like is put on the absorbent material.  The board is placed on top of a honey super with the chemical side down.  When the sun hits the black side of the board the the board is warmed and the checmical evaporates.  As these vapors permeate the honey super the bees are driven down into the hive below and out of the honey super.  The honey super is then removed from the hive.
