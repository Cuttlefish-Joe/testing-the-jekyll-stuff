### *2:30pm Wednesday, February 22nd in Pelton*

This is a one-session class for people who already use the shell, and want to make their experience more comfortable and convenient.
This includes: finding things, terminal multiplexing, your history, interacting with the web, shell prompt, moving around, fuzzy finding, and making friends with vi.

The course will be discussion and demonstration, and will be followed up with an office hour at 2:30 Wednesday, March 1st in M1-A303 if you want help using or setting up the tools demonstrated during the talk.
