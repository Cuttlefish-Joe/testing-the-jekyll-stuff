**Platforms:** Javascript-based sites and web apps

**Extension:** .properties

**Smartling Identifier** javaProperties

**Placeholder Format**: JAVA uses c-style placeholder syntax: %d, %s, %4.2f, etc. and because the % character is an escape character so displaying a single percent character literal requires that it be escaped as %% . When JAVA parsing is on (default) in your source file single percent characters must be escaped as two single percent characters: %% otherwise the % may trigger placeholder treatment and create an invalid placeholder in your string that causes incorrect capture and prevents proper translation.  When JAVA parsing is on Smartling will escape the % character in a translated string if the string has a JAVA formatted placeholder. Otherwise the % character in the translation are delivered unescaped.

If this default behavior is not desirable for your content you can optionally turn off either of the formatting treatments for the entire file or just for the strings where you don't want the behavior.  You can turn the behavior off and on throughout the file as needed.  

You can also specify your own custom placeholder syntax that is in addition to the standard behavior from the above two directives.
